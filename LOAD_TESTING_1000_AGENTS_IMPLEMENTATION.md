## Confidence Scoring Methodology

Each test generates a confidence score (0.0 - 1.0):

**Scoring Criteria:**
- 1.0 = All metrics meet or exceed targets
- 0.8-0.9 = Most metrics meet targets, minor issues
- 0.75-0.79 = Acceptable, some improvements needed
- <0.75 = FAIL, significant issues

**Overall Confidence Calculation:**
```
Overall = (Fleet + Redis + Dashboard + WASM) / 4
Target: ≥0.75 for PASS
```

**Component Weights:**
- Fleet Management: Latency score + Completion score
- Redis Coordination: Creation + Throughput + Election + Recovery
- Dashboard: Latency + Polling + Updates + Stability + Memory
- WASM: Multiplier + Throughput + Memory + Concurrency + Regression
