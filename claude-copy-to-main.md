# Claude Flow Novice - AI Agent Orchestration

## Core Orchestration Patterns

## üö® CRITICAL: MANDATORY AGENT-BASED EXECUTION

**YOU MUST USE AGENTS FOR ALL NON-TRIVIAL WORK - NO EXCEPTIONS**

**ABSOLUTE RULES**:
1. **ALWAYS USE AGENTS** - Tasks requiring >3 steps MUST use agent coordination
2. **ALWAYS INITIALIZE SWARM** - ANY multi-agent task requires swarm_init FIRST
3. **ALWAYS RUN POST-EDIT HOOKS** - After EVERY file edit without exception
4. **ALWAYS BATCH OPERATIONS** - 1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS
4.1 **VALIDATION, REVIEW, AND CONSENSUS AGENTS SHOULD BE LAUNCHED AFTER IMPLEMENTATION IS DONE** - in a separate message. We can't validate work as its being built. 
5. **NEVER WORK SOLO** - Spawn multiple agents in parallel for ALL significant tasks
6. **NEVER SAVE TO ROOT** - Organize files in appropriate subdirectories
7. **USE CLAUDE CODE'S TASK TOOL** - For spawning agents concurrently, not just MCP
8. **USE THE CFN LOOP** - For a self correcting dev loop that saves time and resources
9. **DO NOT CREATE GUIDES, SUMMARIES, OR REPORT FILES** - unless specifically asked. 
10. **USE SPARTAN LANGUAGE** - no fluff encouraged

### üö´ WHEN YOU MUST USE AGENTS (MANDATORY)

**TRIGGER CONDITIONS - If ANY apply, you MUST spawn agents:**
- Task requires >3 distinct steps
- Multiple files need to be created or modified
- Need research + implementation + testing
- Architecture or design decisions required
- Code review or quality validation needed
- Security, performance, or compliance concerns
- Integration across multiple systems/components
- Documentation generation needed
- Refactoring or optimization work
- ANY feature development (even "simple" ones)

## üö® CRITICAL: Safe Test Execution

**NEVER run tests inside agents** - causes memory leaks from orphaned processes.

### Correct Pattern:
```bash
# 1. Run tests ONCE, save results
npm test -- --run --reporter=json > test-results.json 2>&1

# 2. Agents READ results file (no execution)
cat test-results.json

# 3. Kill orphaned processes after swarm
pkill -f vitest; pkill -f "npm test"
```

### Forbidden:
- ‚ùå `Task("agent", "run npm test", "type")` - spawns orphaned process
- ‚ùå Multiple agents running tests concurrently - 3x memory usage
- ‚ùå Long-running test commands without timeout cleanup

### Memory Impact:
- Each test run: 65MB+ heap
- Concurrent runs: 65MB √ó agent_count
- Orphaned processes persist after swarm completion
### Agent Requirements by Task Complexity

| Task Size | Steps | Agent Count | Example Team Composition |
|-----------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Simple** | 3-5 | 2-3 agents | coder + tester + reviewer |
| **Medium** | 6-10 | 4-6 agents | + researcher + architect + security-specialist |
| **Complex** | 11-20 | 8-12 agents | Full specialist team with domain experts |
| **Enterprise** | 20+ | 15-20 agents | + devops + api-docs + perf-analyzer + coordinators |

### ‚ö° GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**MANDATORY PATTERNS:**
- **Agent Spawning**: ALWAYS spawn ALL required agents in ONE message using Task tool
- **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
- **Task tool (Claude Code)**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
- **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
- **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
- **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PROHIBITED SOLO WORK

**YOU ARE FORBIDDEN FROM:**
- ‚ùå Working alone on multi-step tasks
- ‚ùå Implementing features without agent coordination
- ‚ùå Skipping agent spawning because "it's simple"
- ‚ùå Writing code without a tester agent
- ‚ùå Making architectural decisions without an architect agent
- ‚ùå Deploying without security review from security-specialist agent
- ‚ùå Creating reports documents, summary documents, or guides unless explicity asked

## üéØ Claude Code vs MCP Tools

### Claude Code Handles ALL EXECUTION:
- **Task tool**: Spawn and run agents concurrently for actual work
- File operations (Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Glob, Grep)
- Code generation and programming
- Bash commands and system operations
- Implementation work
- Project navigation and analysis
- TodoWrite and task management
- Git operations
- Package management
- Testing and debugging

### MCP Tools ONLY COORDINATE:
- Swarm initialization (topology setup)
- Agent type definitions (coordination patterns)
- Task orchestration (high-level planning)
- Memory management
- Neural features
- Performance tracking
- GitHub integration

**KEY**: MCP coordinates the strategy, Claude Code's Task tool executes with real agents.

### Agent Coordination Framework

#### Pre-Task Hooks (Setup & Validation)
```bash
# Validate safety and prepare resources
npx claude-flow-novice hooks pre-command --command "[command]" --validate-safety true --prepare-resources true

# Auto-assign agents and load context
npx claude-flow-novice hooks pre-edit --file "[file]" --auto-assign-agents true --load-context true
```

#### Post-Edit Hook (MANDATORY After Every File Edit)
```bash
# Unified pipeline: standard validation + TDD + Rust quality
node config/hooks/post-edit-pipeline.js "[FILE]" --memory-key "swarm/[agent]/[step]"

# Enable TDD mode (single-file testing, coverage, phase detection)
node config/hooks/post-edit-pipeline.js "[FILE]" --tdd-mode --minimum-coverage 80

# Enable Rust strict mode (unwrap/expect/panic detection)
node config/hooks/post-edit-pipeline.js "[FILE]" --rust-strict

# Full mode: TDD + Rust + coverage threshold
node config/hooks/post-edit-pipeline.js "[FILE]" --tdd-mode --rust-strict --minimum-coverage 90
```

**Features (all languages):**
- Formatting, linting, type checking, security, dependencies
- Single-file testing (1-5s vs 10-60s full suite)
- Real-time coverage (Jest, pytest, cargo-tarpaulin)
- TDD compliance (Red-Green-Refactor detection)
- Rust quality (unwrap/expect/panic with line numbers)
- Comment-aware validation, structured JSON output
- Logs to `post-edit-pipeline.log` (500 entries max)

#### Session Management
```bash
# Generate summaries and persist state
npx claude-flow-novice hooks session-end --generate-summary true --persist-state true --export-metrics true
```
### üéØ Swarm Initialization (MANDATORY for ALL Multi-Agent Tasks)

**CRITICAL**: You MUST initialize swarm BEFORE spawning ANY multiple agents:

```javascript
[Single Message]:
  // Step 1: ALWAYS initialize swarm first
  mcp__claude-flow-novice__swarm_init({
    topology: "mesh",          // mesh (2-7 agents), hierarchical (8+)
    maxAgents: 3,              // Match your actual agent count
    strategy: "balanced"       // ensures agents coordinate and stay consistent
  })

  // Step 2: Spawn working agents via Task tool
  Task("Agent 1", "Specific instructions...", "type")
  Task("Agent 2", "Specific instructions...", "type")
  Task("Agent 3", "Specific instructions...", "type")
```

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- ‚úÖ **Prevents inconsistency**: Without swarm, 3 agents fixing JWT secrets will use 3 different methods
- ‚úÖ **Ensures coordination**: Agents share findings and agree on approach
- ‚úÖ **Memory coordination**: Agents access shared context via SwarmMemory
- ‚úÖ **Byzantine consensus**: Final validation ensures all agents agree

**TOPOLOGY SELECTION:**
- **2-7 agents**: Use `topology: "mesh"` (peer-to-peer, equal collaboration)
- **8+ agents**: Use `topology: "hierarchical"` (coordinator-led structure)

**MCP Integration Tools:**
- `mcp__claude-flow-novice__swarm_init` - Initialize swarm topology (REQUIRED for ALL multi-agent tasks)
- `mcp__claude-flow-novice__agent_spawn` - Spawn coordination agents (recommended for consistency)
- `mcp__claude-flow-novice__task_orchestrate` - Orchestrate high-level workflows
- **Monitoring**: `swarm_status`, `agent_metrics`, `task_results`
- **Memory**: `memory_usage`, `memory_search`

---

## üìã AGENT COORDINATION RULES

### Universal Agent Spawning Pattern

**EVERY multi-agent task follows this structure:**

```javascript
[Single Message]:
  // Step 1: ALWAYS initialize swarm first
  mcp__claude-flow-novice__swarm_init({
    topology: "mesh",          // or "hierarchical" for 8+ agents
    maxAgents: X,              // match your actual agent count
    strategy: "balanced"       // or "adaptive" for complex tasks
  })

  // Step 2: Spawn ALL agents concurrently
  Task("Agent Name", "Specific task instructions", "agent-type")
  Task("Agent Name", "Specific task instructions", "agent-type")
  Task("Agent Name", "Specific task instructions", "agent-type")
  // ... continue for all agents
```

### Coordination Checklist

**Before spawning agents, ensure:**
- ‚úÖ Task analyzed and complexity assessed (Simple/Medium/Complex/Enterprise)
- ‚úÖ Agent count determined from requirements table
- ‚úÖ Agent types selected for specific needs (not generic roles)
- ‚úÖ Topology chosen: mesh (2-7) or hierarchical (8+)
- ‚úÖ All agents will spawn in SINGLE message
- ‚úÖ Each agent has specific, non-overlapping instructions

**During execution:**
- ‚úÖ Agents coordinate through SwarmMemory
- ‚úÖ Self-validation runs before consensus
- ‚úÖ Each agent runs Post-edit hooks execute after file changes

**After completion:**
- ‚úÖ Consensus validation achieved (‚â•90% agreement)
- ‚úÖ Results stored in memory
- ‚úÖ Next steps determined

### Agent Selection Guide

**Core Development**: coder, tester, reviewer
**Backend**: backend-dev, api-docs, system-architect
**Frontend**: coder (specialized), mobile-dev
**Quality**: tester, reviewer, security-specialist, perf-analyzer
**Planning**: researcher, planner, architect
**Operations**: devops-engineer, cicd-engineer
**Documentation**: api-docs, researcher

**Select agents based on actual task needs, not predefined patterns.**

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Real-World Example: Why Swarm Coordination Matters

**WITHOUT swarm_init (problematic):**
```javascript
// ‚ùå BAD: Agents work independently with no coordination
[Single Message]:
  Task("Agent 1", "Fix JWT secret issue", "coder")
  Task("Agent 2", "Fix JWT secret issue", "coder")
  Task("Agent 3", "Fix JWT secret issue", "coder")

// Result: 3 different solutions - environment variable, config file, hardcoded
// Problem: Inconsistent approach, wasted effort, integration conflicts
```

**WITH swarm_init (correct):**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Agents coordinate through swarm
[Single Message]:
  mcp__claude-flow-novice__swarm_init({
    topology: "mesh",
    maxAgents: 3,
    strategy: "balanced"
  })

  Task("Agent 1", "Fix JWT secret issue", "coder")
  Task("Agent 2", "Fix JWT secret issue", "coder")
  Task("Agent 3", "Fix JWT secret issue", "coder")

// Result: All 3 agents agree on environment variable approach
// Benefit: Consistent solution, shared context, coordinated implementation
```

## File Organization
- **Never save working files to root**

# Add MCP server
claude mcp add claude-flow-novice npx claude-flow-novice mcp start


## Essential Commands
- `npx claude-flow-novice status` - System health
- `npx claude-flow-novice --help` - Available commands
- `/fullstack "goal"` - Launch full-stack development team with consensus validation
- `/swarm`, `/sparc`, `/hooks` - Other slash commands (auto-discovered)

```

### Loop 0: Epic/Sprint Orchestration (Multi-Phase Projects)
**Highest level** - Manages large implementations broken into phases/sprints
- Use `/cfn-loop-epic` for multi-phase projects (e.g., complete auth system)
- Use `/cfn-loop-sprints` for single phase with multiple sprints
- Coordinates cross-phase dependencies
- **No iteration limit** - continues until all phases/sprints complete

### Loop 1: Phase Execution (Implementation Plan)
**Outer loop** - Iterates through implementation plan phases
- Each phase = major deliverable or milestone
- Phases execute sequentially: Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2 ‚Üí Phase 3
- Auto-transitions to next phase when current phase achieves ‚â•90% consensus
- **No iteration limit** - continues until all phases complete

### Loop 2: Consensus Validation (Gate ‚Üí Validators)
**Middle loop** - Validates phase completion before progression
- **Max iterations**: 10 per phase
- **Exit condition**: ‚â•90% consensus OR max iterations

**Loop 2 Flow:**
```
1. Execute Loop 3 (Primary Swarm)
2. Self-Assessment Gate
   - ALL agents ‚â•75%? ‚Üí Spawn Consensus Swarm
   - ANY agent <75%? ‚Üí Relaunch Loop 3 with targeted agents
3. Consensus Validation
   - ‚â•90% approval? ‚Üí Exit Loop 2, proceed to next phase
   - <90% approval? ‚Üí Relaunch Loop 3 with validator feedback
```

### Loop 3: Primary Swarm Execution (Implementation)
**Inner loop** - Agents implement and self-validate
- **Max iterations**: 10 per subtask
- **Exit condition**: ALL agents ‚â•75% confidence OR max iterations

---

## CFN LOOP DETAILED STEPS

### Step 1: Initialize Swarm (ALWAYS for multi-agent tasks)
```javascript
[Single Message]:
  // ALWAYS initialize swarm when spawning multiple agents
  mcp__claude-flow-novice__swarm_init({
    topology: "mesh",          // mesh for 2-7, hierarchical for 8+
    maxAgents: 3,              // match your actual agent count
    strategy: "balanced"       // ensures coordination and consistency
  })

  // Then spawn all agents - they will coordinate via swarm
  Task("Agent 1", "Specific instructions + MUST report confidence score", "type")
  Task("Agent 2", "Specific instructions + MUST report confidence score", "type")
  Task("Agent 3", "Specific instructions + MUST report confidence score", "type")
```

**CRITICAL**: Without swarm_init, agents work independently and produce inconsistent results!

### Step 2: Execute - Primary Swarm (Loop 3 execution)
- **Primary swarm** (3-8 agents minimum) produces deliverables with confidence scores
- **Self-validation**: Each agent validates own work and reports confidence
- **Cross-agent coordination**: Agents share findings via SwarmMemory
- **Confidence reporting**: ALL agents MUST report scores in this format:

```json
{
  "agent": "coder-1",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "All tests passing, security checks clean, no blocking issues",
  "blockers": []
}
```

**Confidence Score Interpretation:**
- **0.90-1.00**: Excellent - production ready
- **0.75-0.89**: Good - minor improvements possible
- **0.60-0.74**: Fair - significant issues remain
- **0.00-0.59**: Poor - major rework needed

### Step 3: Self-Assessment Gate (MANDATORY CHECK)
**GATE LOGIC:**
- **Collect**: Gather confidence scores from ALL primary swarm agents
- **Evaluate**: Check if ALL agents meet ‚â•75% confidence threshold
- **Decision**:
  - ‚úÖ **PASS** (all agents ‚â•75%) ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY proceed to Step 4 (Consensus Verification)
  - ‚ùå **FAIL** (any agent <75%) ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY relaunch Loop 3 swarm with targeted agents

**Loop 3 Iteration Limits:**
- Iteration < 10: IMMEDIATELY relaunch Loop 3 swarm with different/additional agents based on issues
- Iteration ‚â• 10: Escalate to human with diagnostic report
- **NO APPROVAL NEEDED**: Self-correction happens automatically

**Agent Selection for Retry:**
- Analyze which agents failed and WHY
- Spawn DIFFERENT agents if needed (backend-dev instead of coder, security-specialist for auth issues)
- Add ADDITIONAL agents to address gaps (missing tester, missing security review)
- Inject specific feedback for each agent type

**Feedback Injection Format:**
```json
{
  "iteration": 3,
  "failed_agents": ["coder-2", "tester-1"],
  "confidence_scores": {
    "coder-1": 0.85,
    "coder-2": 0.68,
    "tester-1": 0.72
  },
  "focus_areas": [
    "coder-2: Improve error handling in auth module",
    "tester-1: Add integration tests for API endpoints"
  ],
  "recommended_agents": {
    "replace": ["coder-2 ‚Üí backend-dev (auth expertise needed)"],
    "add": ["security-specialist (auth validation)"]
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Verify - Consensus Swarm (2-4 validators REQUIRED)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Sequential Spawning to Prevent Premature Validation**

Validators MUST spawn in **separate message** AFTER implementation completes AND gate passes:

```javascript
// MESSAGE 1: Implementation swarm only (NO REVIEWERS/VALIDATORS)
[Implementation Message]:
  mcp__claude-flow-novice__swarm_init({
    topology: "mesh",
    maxAgents: 3,
    strategy: "balanced"
  })

  Task("Coder 1", "Implement feature X + report confidence", "coder")
  Task("Coder 2", "Implement feature Y + report confidence", "backend-dev")
  Task("Coder 3", "Implement feature Z + report confidence", "rust-expert")

// [WAIT FOR COMPLETION + GATE PASS (ALL ‚â•75%)]

// MESSAGE 2: Validation swarm AFTER implementation complete
[Validation Message]:
  mcp__claude-flow-novice__swarm_init({
    topology: "mesh",
    maxAgents: 4,
    strategy: "balanced"
  })

  Task("Validator 1", "Review completed work at [specific files]", "reviewer")
  Task("Validator 2", "Security audit of completed implementation", "security-specialist")
  Task("Validator 3", "Architecture validation of completed system", "system-architect")
  Task("Validator 4", "Integration testing of completed features", "tester")
```

**WHY SEQUENTIAL SPAWNING:**
- ‚úÖ Prevents validators from reviewing incomplete work-in-progress
- ‚úÖ Ensures all implementation is finished AND confident before validation
- ‚úÖ Avoids wasted validation cycles on low-confidence code
- ‚úÖ Produces accurate consensus scores on completed deliverables

- **Byzantine consensus voting** across all validators
- **Multi-dimensional checks**: quality, security, performance, tests, docs

### Step 5: Product Owner Decision Gate (GOAP Decision Authority)

**üéØ CRITICAL: Product Owner uses GOAP algorithm for autonomous decisions**

After consensus validation, Product Owner agent makes autonomous PROCEED/DEFER/ESCALATE decision:

```javascript
// Spawn Product Owner AFTER consensus results available
Task("Product Owner", `
  GOAP DECISION EXECUTION - Loop 2 Iteration ${iteration}/10

  CURRENT STATE:
  - Consensus: ${consensusScore} (target: ‚â•0.90)
  - Validator concerns: ${JSON.stringify(concerns)}
  - Loop 2 iteration: ${loop2Iteration}/10
  - Scope boundaries: ${scope}

  GOAL STATE:
  - Consensus: ‚â•0.90
  - All in-scope criteria met: true
  - Scope intact: true

  RETRIEVE SCOPE FROM MEMORY:
  mcp__claude-flow-novice__memory_usage({
    action: "retrieve",
    namespace: "scope-control",
    key: "project-boundaries"
  })

  EXECUTE GOAP A* SEARCH:
  1. Classify validator concerns: in-scope vs out-of-scope
  2. Generate action space with cost functions
  3. Run A* pathfinding from current ‚Üí goal state
  4. Make autonomous decision (NO PERMISSION)

  OUTPUT: {decision: "PROCEED|DEFER|ESCALATE", ...}
`, "product-owner")
```

**Decision Outcomes:**

- **PROCEED** (in-scope blockers found) ‚Üí
  - Product Owner selects targeted Loop 3 agents
  - IMMEDIATELY relaunch Loop 3 with specific fixes
  - NO PERMISSION NEEDED (iteration < 10)

- **DEFER** (out-of-scope concerns) ‚Üí
  - Save concerns to backlog
  - Approve phase at current state
  - AUTO-TRANSITION to next phase

- **ESCALATE** (critical ambiguity, rare) ‚Üí
  - Generate options with recommendations
  - Only when truly blocked or high-risk

### Step 6: Action Based on Decision
- **PROCEED Decision** ‚Üí
  1. Product Owner output specifies Loop 3 agents and focus areas
  2. IMMEDIATELY spawn Loop 3 swarm with targeted agents
  3. NO APPROVAL NEEDED (autonomous execution)

- **DEFER Decision** ‚Üí
  1. Store deferred items in backlog memory
  2. Update phase status to complete
  3. IMMEDIATELY transition to next phase

- **ESCALATE Decision** ‚Üí
  1. Generate diagnostic report with alternatives
  2. Suggest agent strategy adjustments
  3. Only STOP if explicit human halt request

**Consensus Failure - Relaunch Loop 3 with Targeted Agents:**
```json
{
  "consensus_score": 0.82,
  "failed_criteria": ["security", "test_coverage"],
  "validator_feedback": {
    "security-specialist": "SQL injection vulnerability in user input handler",
    "tester": "Integration test coverage at 45%, need 80%+"
  },
  "required_actions": [
    "Fix SQL injection in src/handlers/user.js:45",
    "Add integration tests for /api/users endpoints"
  ],
  "loop3_relaunch_plan": {
    "agents": [
      "backend-dev: Fix SQL injection in src/handlers/user.js:45",
      "tester: Add integration tests for /api/users (target 80%+ coverage)",
      "security-specialist: Validate SQL injection fix and scan for similar issues"
    ],
    "action": "IMMEDIATELY spawn Loop 3 swarm with these agents (NO approval needed)"
  }
}
```

### üö® ENFORCEMENT CHECKPOINTS

**MANDATORY before proceeding:**
1. ‚úÖ Swarm initialized with topology and strategy
2. ‚úÖ Primary agents spawned with confidence reporting instructions
3. ‚úÖ Each file edit followed by enhanced post-edit hook
4. ‚úÖ Self-assessment gate evaluated (ALL agents ‚â•75%)
5. ‚úÖ Consensus swarm spawned ONLY after gate passes
6. ‚úÖ Byzantine voting completed (‚â•90% for approval)
7. ‚úÖ Results stored in SwarmMemory
8. ‚úÖ Loop iteration counters tracked (Loop 2 ‚â§10, Loop 3 ‚â§10)

## üîÑ AUTONOMOUS CFN LOOP EXECUTION

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: The CFN Loop is a SELF-CORRECTING, SELF-LOOPING process. You MUST continue iterations autonomously without waiting for human approval but automatically relaunching a loops' swarms or proceeding to the next phase

### Autonomous Behavior Rules:

1. **Consensus Fails (Loop 2 iteration 1-9/10)**
   - IMMEDIATELY analyze validator feedback to identify issues
   - IMMEDIATELY relaunch Loop 3 swarm with targeted/different agents based on issues
   - DO NOT ask "Should I retry?" - ALWAYS retry within iteration limits
   - DO NOT wait for human confirmation - PROCEED automatically
   - Example: Security issue? Add security-specialist to Loop 3 swarm

2. **Confidence Below Threshold (Loop 3 iteration 1-9/10)**
   - IMMEDIATELY analyze which agents failed and WHY
   - IMMEDIATELY relaunch Loop 3 swarm with different/additional agents
   - Replace failing agents with specialists (coder ‚Üí backend-dev for API work)
   - Add missing expertise (security-specialist, perf-analyzer)
   - DO NOT escalate prematurely - RETRY with better agent selection first
   - DO NOT pause for approval - CONTINUE self-correcting

3. **Phase Completion (Loop 1 progression)**
   - IMMEDIATELY validate completion criteria
   - IMMEDIATELY check next phase dependencies
   - IMMEDIATELY transition to next phase if ready
   - DO NOT ask "Proceed to Phase 2?" - AUTO-TRANSITION

4. **Max Iterations Reached (Loop 2 ‚â•10 OR Loop 3 ‚â•10)**
   - Generate escalation guidance with specific recommendations
   - Suggest alternative agent combinations or approaches
   - Only STOP if critical error or explicit human halt request

### üö´ FORBIDDEN: Permission-Asking Patterns

**YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN FROM:**
- ‚ùå Asking "Should I retry?" when iterations remain (ALWAYS retry autonomously)
- ‚ùå Asking "Proceed to next phase?" when criteria met (AUTO-TRANSITION)
- ‚ùå Asking "Would you like me to..." for autonomous decisions (EXECUTE immediately)
- ‚ùå Waiting for approval to continue self-correction (PROCEED without permission)
- ‚ùå Pausing for confirmation during CFN Loop cycles (CONTINUOUS execution)

**FORBIDDEN Example:**
```
Loop 2 Iteration 2/10 - Consensus: 75%
Architect identified 5 gaps.

Would you like me to proceed with Loop 3 Iteration 3/10? ‚ùå WRONG
```

**REQUIRED Pattern:**
```
Loop 2 Iteration 2/10 - Consensus: 75%

Product Owner Decision: PROCEED (GOAP A* search, cost=50)
- 4 in-scope blockers identified
- IMMEDIATELY relaunching Loop 3 Iteration 3/10

Spawning targeted agents NOW:
- backend-dev: Fix HelpMatcher duplication
- architect: MessageBroker routing
[Executing autonomously - no permission needed] ‚úÖ CORRECT
```

### Self-Looping Prompt Templates:

When continuing iterations, use these patterns:

**Loop 3 Retry (Low Confidence):**
```
Loop 3 Iteration {N}/10 - Confidence check failed.
Low-confidence agents: coder-auth (72%), tester-api (68%)

Analysis:
- coder-auth (72%): Auth module error handling incomplete
- backend-dev-db (85%): PASSING
- tester-api (68%): Integration test coverage insufficient

IMMEDIATELY relaunching Loop 3 swarm with adjusted agents:
Replacing:
- coder-auth ‚Üí backend-dev (auth expertise)
Adding:
- security-specialist (validate auth implementation)

New Loop 3 swarm:
- backend-dev: Fix error handling in auth module + validate token expiration
- backend-dev-db: Continue (already confident)
- tester: Add integration tests for /api/users (target 80%+)
- security-specialist: Review auth security (NEW)

Spawning Loop 3 agents NOW. Self-correcting loop active.
```

**Loop 2 Retry (Consensus Failed):**
```
Loop 2 Iteration {N}/10 - Consensus: 82% (below 90% threshold)

Validator feedback:
- security-specialist: SQL injection vulnerability in user input handler
- tester: Integration test coverage at 45%, need 80%+

IMMEDIATELY relaunching Loop 3 swarm to address validator concerns:
Targeted agents for issues:
- backend-dev: Fix SQL injection in src/handlers/user.js:45
- tester: Add integration tests for /api/users (target 80%+)
- security-specialist: Validate fix and scan for similar vulnerabilities

Spawning Loop 3 swarm NOW. NO approval needed. Self-looping process continues.
```

**Loop 1 Phase Transition:**
```
Phase {N} complete. Consensus: 94% ‚úÖ

Completion criteria met:
‚úÖ All deliverables implemented
‚úÖ Test coverage: 87%
‚úÖ Security audit passed
‚úÖ Documentation updated

Dependencies satisfied for Phase {N+1}.

IMMEDIATELY transitioning to next phase:
{Phase description}

Auto-transitioning NOW. No approval needed.
```

### When to STOP Self-Looping:

ONLY stop autonomous execution when:
- ‚úÖ All phases complete successfully (Loop 1 finished)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical compilation/security error
- üõë Explicit user command: "STOP" or "PAUSE"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Loop 2 iteration ‚â•10 AND Loop 3 iteration ‚â•10 (dual limits reached)

### Continuation Decision Logic:

```javascript
// Loop 3 (Primary Swarm Confidence Check)
if (anyAgentConfidence < 0.75 && loop3Iteration < 10) {
  // Analyze failures and select better agents
  const failedAgents = agents.filter(a => a.confidence < 0.75);
  const replacements = selectBetterAgents(failedAgents);
  return "IMMEDIATELY relaunch Loop 3 with " + replacements.join(", ");
}

// Loop 2 (Consensus Validation)
if (consensusScore < 0.90 && loop2Iteration < 10) {
  // Extract validator concerns and spawn targeted Loop 3 agents
  const issues = extractValidatorIssues(consensusResult);
  const targetedAgents = selectAgentsForIssues(issues);
  return "IMMEDIATELY relaunch Loop 3 with " + targetedAgents.join(", ");
}

// Loop 1 (Phase Progression)
if (phaseComplete && nextPhaseReady) {
  return "IMMEDIATELY transition to next phase";
}

// Escalation conditions
if (loop2Iteration >= 10 || loop3Iteration >= 10) {
  return "Generate alternative agent strategy and retry OR escalate";
}

if (criticalError || userHalt) {
  return "STOP and escalate";
}
```

### Example Self-Looping Session:

```
[Turn 1] Initialize Phase 1
         ‚Üí Loop 3 Iteration 1/10
         ‚Üí Primary Swarm spawned
         ‚Üí Confidence: Agent A: 68%, Agent B: 85%, Agent C: 72%
         ‚Üí Gate FAILS (agents A & C below 75%)
         ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY retry Loop 3 with feedback (no approval needed)

[Turn 2] Loop 3 Iteration 2/10
         ‚Üí Primary Swarm relaunched with feedback
         ‚Üí Confidence: Agent A: 82%, Agent B: 88%, Agent C: 79%
         ‚Üí Gate PASSES (all ‚â•75%)
         ‚Üí Proceed to Loop 2 (Consensus Validation)

[Turn 3] Loop 2 Iteration 1/10
         ‚Üí Consensus Swarm spawned
         ‚Üí Consensus: 85% (below 90%)
         ‚Üí Validator feedback: security concerns, test coverage
         ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY retry Loop 2 with feedback

[Turn 4] Loop 2 Iteration 2/10
         ‚Üí Loop 3 executed (primary swarm with validator feedback)
         ‚Üí Confidence: 91% average
         ‚Üí Consensus Swarm re-validated
         ‚Üí Consensus: 94% ‚úÖ
         ‚Üí Phase 1 COMPLETE
         ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY transition to Phase 2

[Turn 5] Phase 2 execution begins...
```

**NOTICE**: No human approval requested. System self-loops continuously.

### Critical Autonomous Execution Reminders:

**YOU ARE FORBIDDEN FROM:**
- ‚ùå Asking "Should I retry?" when iterations remain
- ‚ùå Asking "Proceed to next phase?" when criteria met
- ‚ùå Waiting for approval to continue self-correction
- ‚ùå Stopping prematurely before iteration limits
- ‚ùå Escalating without attempting alternatives first
- ‚ùå Pausing for confirmation during autonomous cycles

**YOU ARE REQUIRED TO:**
- ‚úÖ IMMEDIATELY relaunch Loop 3 on consensus failure with targeted agents (if Loop 2 iteration < 10)
- ‚úÖ IMMEDIATELY relaunch Loop 3 on low confidence with different/additional agents (if Loop 3 iteration < 10)
- ‚úÖ IMMEDIATELY transition phases when criteria met
- ‚úÖ AUTOMATICALLY select better agents based on failure analysis
- ‚úÖ CONTINUOUSLY self-loop until success or limits reached
- ‚úÖ ONLY escalate when truly blocked (critical error or iteration limits reached)

### Autonomous Execution Metrics:

Track these internally (no user prompts):
- Loop 0: Current epic/sprint (e.g., Epic: auth-system, Phase 2/4, Sprint 1.3/1.5)
- Loop 1: Current phase number (e.g., Phase 2/4)
- Loop 2: Iteration counter (e.g., 3/10)
- Loop 3: Iteration counter (e.g., 7/10)
- Confidence scores by agent (e.g., backend-dev: 82%, tester: 68%)
- Consensus percentage (e.g., 87%)
- Agent adjustments (e.g., Replaced coder ‚Üí backend-dev, Added security-specialist)
- Critical blockers (if any)

**Output Format** (concise, action-oriented):
```
Loop 3 Iteration 2/10 - Confidence: 82% avg (target: 75%) ‚úÖ
All agents passing gate. Proceeding to Loop 2 (Consensus)...

Loop 2 Iteration 1/10 - Consensus: 87% (target: 90%) ‚ùå
Validator feedback: [SQL injection, test coverage 45%]
IMMEDIATELY relaunching Loop 3 with targeted agents:
- backend-dev (fix SQL injection)
- tester (increase coverage to 80%+)
- security-specialist (validate fix)

[Loop 3 execution in progress - autonomous retry with new agents]
```
