# Security Reports

Security audit reports, vulnerability assessments, and compliance validation results.

## Purpose

This directory contains security audit outputs from the post-edit pipeline, dependency scans, vulnerability assessments, and security validation results from CFN Loop validators.

## Report Types

### Post-Edit Security Audits
- **Format**: `security-audit-{file}-{date}.json`
- **Content**: eval() detection, hardcoded credentials, XSS vulnerabilities, injection risks
- **Generated**: After every file edit via post-edit-pipeline.js

### Dependency Vulnerability Scans
- **Format**: `dependency-scan-{date}.json`
- **Content**: npm audit results, outdated packages, known CVEs, severity levels
- **Generated**: Daily via CI/CD or manual execution

### Security Validator Reports
- **Format**: `security-validation-{phase}-{date}.md`
- **Content**: CFN Loop 2 security specialist validation, threat analysis, recommendations
- **Generated**: During Loop 2 validation phases

### Penetration Test Reports
- **Format**: `pentest-{scope}-{date}.md`
- **Content**: Security testing results, exploitation attempts, remediation steps
- **Generated**: Manual security testing cycles

## Security Issues Detected

The post-edit hook detects:
- **eval() usage**: Dynamic code execution risks
- **Hardcoded credentials**: API keys, passwords, tokens in code
- **XSS vulnerabilities**: Unescaped user input, innerHTML usage
- **SQL injection risks**: String concatenation in queries
- **Insecure dependencies**: Known CVEs in package.json
- **Weak cryptography**: MD5, SHA1, outdated encryption algorithms

## Usage

Security reports are consumed by:
- CFN Loop 2 security validators
- CI/CD security gates
- Product owner decision gates (Loop 4)
- Compliance audit processes
- Dependency update workflows

## Examples

- `security-audit-auth-service-2025-10-10.json` - Post-edit security check
- `dependency-scan-2025-10-10.json` - Daily npm audit results
- `security-validation-auth-phase-2025-10-10.md` - Loop 2 security validation
- `pentest-api-endpoints-2025-10-01.md` - Penetration test results

## Retention

Keep security reports for 7 years (compliance requirement). Critical vulnerabilities must be remediated before archiving.

## Access Control

**RESTRICTED**: Security reports contain sensitive vulnerability information. Access limited to:
- Project security team
- DevOps engineers
- Compliance officers
- Product owners (summary only)
