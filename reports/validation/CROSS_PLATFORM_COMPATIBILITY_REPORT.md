## Key Findings

### ✅ Working Features

1. **Core CLI Commands**: All primary commands work across platforms
2. **ES Module Support**: Proper ESM/CommonJS interoperability
3. **File System Operations**: Cross-platform path handling working
4. **Network Connectivity**: HTTP/WebSocket servers functional
5. **Process Management**: Agent spawning and coordination working
6. **Authentication**: JWT and bcrypt functionality verified
7. **Memory Management**: Resource usage within acceptable limits

### ⚠️ Platform-Specific Considerations

#### Windows
- **Path Handling**: Requires careful handling of backslashes vs forward slashes
- **Permissions**: Some operations may require Administrator privileges
- **Long Paths**: Traditional 260-character path limit may affect deep directory structures
- **Shell Commands**: Different behavior between PowerShell and CMD

#### macOS
- **File Permissions**: macOS security features may require explicit permissions
- **Network Configuration**: Firewall settings may affect network operations
- **Homebrew Dependency**: Optional but recommended for easier package management

#### Linux
- **Distribution Variations**: Different package managers (apt, yum, dnf, pacman)
- **System Permissions**: May require sudo for certain operations
- **Memory Management**: Different memory allocation behavior across distributions

#### WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- **Path Translation**: Windows paths accessible via /mnt/c/ structure
- **Network Limitations**: Some network features may have limitations
- **Performance**: Slightly reduced performance compared to native Linux

## Recommendations

### For Developers

1. **Node.js Version**: Use Node.js 20.x LTS for production deployments
2. **Path Handling**: Always use `path.join()` and `path.resolve()` for cross-platform compatibility
3. **File Permissions**: Test on target platforms before deployment
4. **Shell Commands**: Avoid platform-specific shell commands when possible

### For Deployment

1. **Windows**: Test with both PowerShell and CMD environments
2. **macOS**: Verify Gatekeeper and security settings
3. **Linux**: Test on target distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, Alpine)
4. **Containers**: Test in Docker/Kubernetes environments

### For Package Distribution

1. **Binary Distribution**: Consider platform-specific binaries for performance
2. **Dependencies**: Verify all dependencies support target platforms
3. **Documentation**: Include platform-specific installation instructions
4. **Testing**: Run compatibility tests before each release

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Apple Silicon Testing**: Requires testing on M1/M2 MacBooks
2. **ARM64 Linux**: Limited testing on ARM64 Linux distributions
3. **Container Environments**: Docker/Kubernetes testing needs expansion
4. **Long Path Support**: Windows long path (>260 chars) needs testing

### Potential Issues

1. **Network Firewalls**: May affect WebSocket connections
2. **Antivirus Software**: May interfere with file operations
3. **System Resource Limits**: May affect swarm scaling
4. **Memory Constraints**: May affect large-scale operations
