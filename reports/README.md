# Reports Directory

Consolidated directory for all project reports, audits, and monitoring outputs generated by the Claude Flow Novice orchestration system.

## Directory Structure

```
reports/
├── sprints/         Sprint reports and phase summaries
├── security/        Security audit reports
├── performance/     Performance benchmark reports
├── validation/      Validation and verification reports
├── audit/           Audit results and compliance reports
└── monitoring/      System monitoring and health reports
```

## Subdirectory Descriptions

### sprints/
Sprint execution reports, phase summaries, and CFN Loop iteration results. Contains detailed breakdowns of each sprint's implementation phases, confidence scores, and completion metrics.

### security/
Security audit reports, vulnerability assessments, and compliance validation results. Includes pre-commit security checks, dependency audits, and threat analysis outputs.

### performance/
Performance benchmark reports, optimization results, and WASM acceleration metrics. Contains profiling data, resource usage analysis, and efficiency measurements.

### validation/
Validation and verification reports from CFN Loop 2 consensus validation phases. Includes validator agent outputs, consensus scores, and quality gate results.

### audit/
Audit results for compliance standards (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA), code quality assessments, and regulatory reporting outputs.

### monitoring/
System monitoring reports, fleet health checks, event bus metrics, and real-time coordination data. Contains Redis state snapshots and swarm telemetry.

## Report Naming Conventions

- **Sprints**: `sprint-{number}-{phase}-{timestamp}.md`
- **Security**: `security-audit-{scope}-{date}.md`
- **Performance**: `perf-{component}-{date}.md`
- **Validation**: `validation-{phase}-loop{number}-{date}.md`
- **Audit**: `audit-{standard}-{scope}-{date}.md`
- **Monitoring**: `monitor-{fleet-id}-{timeframe}.md`

## Usage

Reports are automatically generated by:
- CFN Loop phases (Loop 2 validation, Loop 4 product owner decisions)
- Post-edit pipeline hooks
- Fleet management commands
- Compliance validation tools
- Performance monitoring systems

Refer to individual subdirectory READMEs for specific report formats and examples.

## Retention Policy

- Sprint reports: Keep for project lifetime
- Security/audit reports: Keep for 7 years (compliance requirement)
- Performance reports: Keep latest 90 days
- Validation reports: Keep for current epic + 1 sprint
- Monitoring reports: Keep latest 30 days

## Access Control

Reports may contain sensitive information. Follow these guidelines:
- Security reports: Project team + security specialists only
- Audit reports: Project team + compliance officers
- Performance/validation/monitoring: Project team
- Sprint reports: All stakeholders
