## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** installed and working
- **Node.js 18+** installed on your system
- **Basic understanding** of web development concepts
- **20-30 minutes** for complete tutorial

## 🚀 Step 1: MCP Server Setup (2 minutes)

### Install and Configure MCP Server

In your terminal:

```bash
# Add Claude Flow Novice MCP server to Claude Code
claude mcp add claude-flow-novice npx claude-flow-novice@latest mcp start

# Verify installation
claude mcp status

# Expected output:
📊 MCP Server Status:
┌─────────────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬─────────────┐
│ Name                │ Status   │ Port     │ Tools       │
├─────────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼─────────────┤
│ claude-flow-novice  │ Running  │ 3001     │ 52 active   │
└─────────────────────┴──────────┴──────────┴─────────────┘
```

### Test MCP Connection

In Claude Code, ask:

```
Use the claude-flow-novice MCP tools to check system health and list available agent types
```

You should see Claude Code using MCP tools and reporting:
- ✅ MCP server connectivity confirmed
- ✅ 52 MCP tools available
- ✅ 54+ agent types ready for spawning
- 🎉 System ready for e-commerce development!

## 🏗️ Step 2: Initialize Development Coordination (3 minutes)

### Set Up Hierarchical Swarm

In Claude Code, request:

```
Initialize a hierarchical swarm for e-commerce development with a lead coordinator and specialized teams for frontend, backend, database, and payment integration. Use the MCP tools to set this up.
```

**Expected workflow:**
1. Claude Code uses `mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init` with hierarchical topology
2. Establishes coordinator agent role
3. Defines team specializations
4. Sets up communication channels between teams

### Create Project Structure

Continue in Claude Code:

```
Use MCP tools to orchestrate the creation of a professional e-commerce project structure with separate directories for frontend, backend, database, and shared components.
```

**Claude Code will coordinate:**
- MCP tools for project planning and structure design
- Task tool to spawn agents that create actual directories and files
- Memory storage for project configuration and decisions

## 🎭 Step 3: Spawn Full Development Team (5 minutes)

### The Power of Concurrent Orchestration

In Claude Code, make this comprehensive request:

```
Coordinate a complete e-commerce development team using both MCP coordination and Task tool execution:

1. Use MCP tools to set up the coordination strategy
2. Spawn all necessary agents via Task tool to work in parallel:
   - Backend Lead: Express.js API with MongoDB, authentication, payment processing
   - Frontend Lead: React SPA with modern UI, shopping cart, user dashboard
   - Database Architect: MongoDB schema, indexing, data relationships
   - Payment Specialist: Stripe integration, transaction handling, webhooks
   - Security Expert: Authentication, authorization, data protection
   - Test Engineer: Comprehensive testing across all components
   - DevOps Engineer: Docker setup, deployment configuration

3. Set up real-time coordination between all agents
4. Create a task orchestration plan for the entire project
```

**What happens behind the scenes:**

```javascript
// Claude Code executes this automatically:

// Step 1: MCP Coordination Setup
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init({
  topology: "hierarchical",
  maxAgents: 8,
  coordinator: "fullstack-lead",
  strategy: "adaptive"
})

mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate({
  task: "Build complete e-commerce platform",
  strategy: "parallel",
  priority: "high",
  dependencies: {
    "frontend": ["backend", "payment"],
    "testing": ["frontend", "backend"],
    "deployment": ["all"]
  }
})

// Step 2: Actual Agent Execution via Task Tool
Task("Backend Lead", "Build Express.js API with MongoDB, JWT auth, product catalog, shopping cart, and Stripe payment integration", "backend-dev")

Task("Frontend Lead", "Create React e-commerce SPA with product browsing, shopping cart, user authentication, and checkout flow", "coder")

Task("Database Architect", "Design MongoDB schema for users, products, orders, and cart with proper indexing and relationships", "code-analyzer")

Task("Payment Specialist", "Implement Stripe payment processing with webhook handling and transaction management", "coder")

Task("Security Expert", "Implement comprehensive security: JWT auth, input validation, HTTPS, rate limiting", "security-manager")

Task("Test Engineer", "Create comprehensive test suite: unit, integration, e2e tests with 90%+ coverage", "tester")

Task("DevOps Engineer", "Setup Docker containers, CI/CD pipeline, and deployment configuration", "cicd-engineer")

Task("Documentation Specialist", "Generate API documentation, user guides, and development documentation", "api-docs")
```

## 🔄 Step 4: SPARC Methodology Integration (5 minutes)

### Coordinate SPARC Workflow

In Claude Code:

```
Orchestrate a complete SPARC workflow for the e-commerce platform using MCP coordination. Run all phases in parallel where possible and ensure each agent follows the coordination protocol.
```

**SPARC Phases Executed:**

```javascript
// Phase 1: Specification (coordinated via MCP)
mcp__claude-flow__sparc_mode({
  mode: "specification",
  task_description: "E-commerce platform with full shopping experience",
  options: {
    include_user_stories: true,
    define_acceptance_criteria: true,
    specify_technical_requirements: true
  }
})

// Parallel agent execution via Task tool
Task("Requirements Analyst", "Analyze e-commerce requirements, create user stories, define acceptance criteria", "researcher")

// Phase 2: Architecture Design
Task("System Architect", "Design microservices architecture, API contracts, database schema", "system-architect")

// Phase 3: Implementation Planning
Task("Technical Lead", "Create implementation plan, define coding standards, set up development workflow", "architect")
```

### Monitor SPARC Progress

Continue in Claude Code:

```
Monitor the SPARC workflow progress and show real-time updates from all agents working on different phases.
```

**Real-time monitoring:**
- Specification: Requirements gathering (95% complete)
- Architecture: System design (87% complete)
- Implementation: Code development (72% complete)
- Testing: Test creation (64% complete)
- Documentation: API docs generation (58% complete)

## 🛒 Step 5: Implement Core E-commerce Features (8 minutes)

### Product Catalog System

In Claude Code:

```
Coordinate the implementation of a complete product catalog system with the following agents working in parallel:

1. Backend agent: Create product API endpoints with search, filtering, categories
2. Frontend agent: Build product listing, detail pages, search interface
3. Database agent: Optimize product schema and create search indexes
4. Test agent: Write comprehensive product-related tests

Use MCP coordination to ensure they work together effectively.
```

### Shopping Cart Implementation

Continue with:

```
Now coordinate the shopping cart implementation across the team, ensuring real-time synchronization between frontend and backend cart state.
```

### User Authentication & Profiles

Next:

```
Implement user authentication and profile management with security best practices. Coordinate between security expert, backend team, and frontend team.
```

### Payment Processing Integration

Finally:
