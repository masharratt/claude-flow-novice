## Enterprise Scenario: Microservices Platform Development

You're tasked with building a complete microservices platform with 15+ services, requiring coordination across multiple teams, technologies, and deployment environments.

### Phase 1: Advanced Swarm Architecture Design

#### 1.1 Initialize Enterprise-Scale Coordination

```bash
# Set up the foundational coordination infrastructure
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "Enterprise microservices platform development"
```

**Swarm Topology Design:**
```javascript
// Initialize large-scale hierarchical coordination
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init({
  topology: "hierarchical",
  maxAgents: 20,
  strategy: "enterprise-adaptive",
  coordination: {
    levels: 3,  // Architect → Team Leads → Specialists
    communicationPatterns: ["broadcast", "targeted", "peer-to-peer"],
    decisionMaking: "consensus-with-fallback",
    faultTolerance: "self-healing"
  }
})
```

#### 1.2 Specialized Agent Teams Creation

```javascript
// Architecture Leadership Layer
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn({
  type: "system-architect",
  name: "enterprise-architect",
  capabilities: [
    "system-design",
    "technology-strategy",
    "cross-team-coordination",
    "architectural-governance"
  ],
  coordination: {
    role: "leader",
    influence: "high",
    decisionAuthority: "architectural"
  }
})

// Team Lead Layer
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn({
  type: "coordinator",
  name: "backend-team-lead",
  capabilities: [
    "microservices-architecture",
    "api-design",
    "team-coordination",
    "technical-leadership"
  ],
  coordination: {
    role: "team-lead",
    influence: "medium",
    reports: "enterprise-architect"
  }
})

mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn({
  type: "coordinator",
  name: "frontend-team-lead",
  capabilities: [
    "micro-frontend-architecture",
    "user-experience",
    "team-coordination",
    "technical-leadership"
  ],
  coordination: {
    role: "team-lead",
    influence: "medium",
    reports: "enterprise-architect"
  }
})

mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn({
  type: "coordinator",
  name: "devops-team-lead",
  capabilities: [
    "infrastructure-architecture",
    "deployment-strategy",
    "monitoring-design",
    "team-coordination"
  ],
  coordination: {
    role: "team-lead",
    influence: "medium",
    reports: "enterprise-architect"
  }
})
```

#### 1.3 Specialist Agent Teams

```javascript
// Backend Development Specialists
for (let i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
  mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn({
    type: "specialist",
    name: `backend-specialist-${i}`,
    capabilities: [
      "microservice-development",
      "database-design",
      "api-implementation",
      "testing"
    ],
    coordination: {
      role: "specialist",
      reports: "backend-team-lead",
      specialization: `service-cluster-${i}`
    }
  })
}

// Frontend Development Specialists
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn({
    type: "specialist",
    name: `frontend-specialist-${i}`,
    capabilities: [
      "react-development",
      "micro-frontend-patterns",
      "state-management",
      "ui-testing"
    ],
    coordination: {
      role: "specialist",
      reports: "frontend-team-lead",
      specialization: `frontend-module-${i}`
    }
  })
}

// DevOps and Infrastructure Specialists
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn({
    type: "specialist",
    name: `devops-specialist-${i}`,
    capabilities: [
      "kubernetes-orchestration",
      "ci-cd-pipeline",
      "monitoring-setup",
      "security-implementation"
    ],
    coordination: {
      role: "specialist",
      reports: "devops-team-lead",
      specialization: `infrastructure-domain-${i}`
    }
  })
}
```

### Phase 2: Dynamic Workflow Orchestration

#### 2.1 Complex Task Orchestration Setup

```javascript
// Define enterprise-level task orchestration
mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate({
  task: "Build complete microservices platform with 15+ services",
  strategy: "adaptive",
  priority: "critical",
  coordination: {
    phases: [
      "architecture-design",
      "infrastructure-setup",
      "parallel-development",
      "integration-testing",
      "deployment-orchestration"
    ],
    dependencies: {
      "infrastructure-setup": ["architecture-design"],
      "parallel-development": ["infrastructure-setup"],
      "integration-testing": ["parallel-development"],
      "deployment-orchestration": ["integration-testing"]
    },
    parallelization: {
      "parallel-development": {
        maxConcurrency: 12,
        loadBalancing: "dynamic",
        coordination: "real-time"
      }
    }
  }
})
```

#### 2.2 Advanced Coordination Patterns

**Hierarchical Decision Making:**
```javascript
// Implement consensus-based decision making with hierarchical fallback
mcp__claude-flow__coordination_sync({
  pattern: "hierarchical-consensus",
  decisionFlow: {
    "technical-decisions": {
      initiator: "any-specialist",
      reviewers: ["team-lead", "peers"],
      escalation: "enterprise-architect",
      timeouts: {
        peer_review: "2h",
        team_lead_review: "4h",
        architect_escalation: "24h"
      }
    },
    "architectural-decisions": {
      initiator: "team-lead",
      reviewers: ["enterprise-architect"],
      escalation: "external-review",
      authority: "enterprise-architect"
    }
  }
})
```

**Dynamic Load Balancing:**
```javascript
// Implement intelligent load balancing across agents
mcp__claude-flow__load_balance({
  tasks: [
    "user-service-development",
    "order-service-development",
    "payment-service-development",
    "inventory-service-development",
    "notification-service-development",
    "analytics-service-development"
  ],
  balancing: {
    algorithm: "capability-weighted",
    factors: ["agent-specialization", "current-load", "past-performance"],
    adaptation: "real-time",
    optimization: "throughput-and-quality"
  }

      limit: "max-agents * 1.5"
    },
    "low-coordination-efficiency": {
      trigger: "decision-latency > 5min",
