  agents: ["all-active"],
  analysis: ["bandwidth", "latency", "conflicts"]
})

// Optimize communication patterns
mcp__claude-flow__coordination_optimize({
  strategy: "reduce-chatter",
  priority: "performance"

```

### Recovery Strategies
```bash
# Save coordination state
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm checkpoint --name "pre-optimization"

# Restore from known good state
