- Add arrow pointer (F3)
- Add text overlay (F4)
```
```

### üé§ Audio Techniques

#### Narration Best Practices
```markdown
**Speaking Techniques:**

- Breathing sounds: Position mic to side
- Echo/reverb: Add acoustic treatment
- Background noise: Use noise gate/suppression
```

#### Synchronization
```markdown
**Audio-Visual Sync:**
- Start narration slightly before action
- Pause narration during complex operations
- Describe what viewers see happening
- Use transitions between major sections

**Timing Techniques:**
- Allow time for viewers to read text
- Pause after questions (even if rhetorical)
- Give time to absorb complex information
- Match speaking pace to action complexity
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Recording Issues

#### Audio Problems
```markdown
**Low Audio Quality:**
- Check microphone positioning (6-8 inches from mouth)
- Verify input levels (-12dB to -18dB average)
- Test different sample rates (48kHz recommended)
- Use pop filter and proper acoustic treatment

**Audio Sync Issues:**
- Ensure audio and video use same sample rate
- Check for buffer overflow in recording software
- Use wired headphones instead of Bluetooth
- Close other audio applications during recording

**Background Noise:**
- Use noise suppression filters
- Record during quieter times
- Improve acoustic treatment of room
- Use directional microphone patterns
```

#### Video Problems
```markdown
**Poor Video Quality:**
- Increase recording bitrate (5000-8000 Kbps)
- Use hardware encoding if available
- Record at native monitor resolution
- Ensure sufficient disk space and CPU resources

**Choppy/Laggy Recording:**
- Close unnecessary applications
- Lower recording quality temporarily
- Use faster storage (SSD recommended)
- Update graphics drivers

**Display Issues:**
- Use consistent scaling across monitors
- Avoid recording during high CPU tasks
- Test with different recording regions
- Verify monitor refresh rate settings
```

#### Software-Specific Solutions

##### OBS Studio
```markdown
**Common OBS Issues:**

**High CPU Usage:**
```bash
# Reduce CPU load
- Use hardware encoding (NVENC/AMF)
- Lower output resolution
- Reduce frame rate to 30fps
- Close preview window during recording
```

**Audio Delay:**
```bash
# Fix audio sync
1. Right-click audio source
2. Select "Advanced Audio Properties"
3. Adjust "Sync Offset" in milliseconds
4. Test with clap test
```

**Recording Stutters:**
```bash
# Performance optimization
1. Settings > Output > Recording
2. Set Rate Control to "CBR"
3. Enable "Rescale Output" to 1080p
4. Use "fast" x264 preset
```
```

##### Camtasia
```markdown
**Camtasia Optimization:**

**Large File Sizes:**
- Use Smart Player format for editing
- Reduce canvas dimensions if needed
- Optimize export settings for target platform
- Use variable bitrate encoding

**Slow Performance:**
- Enable hardware acceleration
- Clear media cache regularly
- Work with proxy media for large files
- Close other applications during editing
```

### Performance Optimization

#### System Optimization
```bash
# Windows performance tweaks
# Set recording software to high priority
wmic process where name="obs64.exe" CALL setpriority "high priority"

# Disable Windows Game Mode during recording
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\GameBar" /v AllowAutoGameMode /t REG_DWORD /d 0

# macOS performance tweaks
# Increase recording software priority
sudo renice -10 -p $(pgrep OBS)

# Disable Spotlight indexing during recording
sudo mdutil -a -i off

# Linux performance tweaks
# Set CPU governor to performance
echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

# Increase recording process priority
sudo nice -n -10 obs
```

#### Storage Optimization
```markdown
**Recording Storage:**
- Use fastest available storage (NVMe SSD)
- Ensure 10GB+ free space per hour of recording
- Use separate drive for recordings vs system
- Monitor disk space during long recordings

**Backup Strategy:**
- Immediate backup to second location
- Cloud backup for important recordings
- Version control for edited content
- Regular cleanup of old raw recordings
```
