# Multi-Project Coordination and Governance

## Overview

As organizations scale claude-flow across multiple projects and teams, robust governance and coordination mechanisms become critical. This document outlines proven patterns for managing complex multi-project environments with 100+ developers.

## Governance Framework

### 1. Organizational Structure

    end

    subgraph "Portfolio Management"
        PPM[Portfolio Manager]

        PLAT[Platform Team<br/>Claude-Flow Ops]
        INFRA[Infrastructure Team]
        SEC_TEAM[Security Team]
    end

    CTO --> PPM

## Project Coordination Mechanisms

### 1. Cross-Project Dependencies

```yaml
# Project Dependency Configuration
dependencies:
  upstream:
    - project: "user-service"
      artifacts: ["api-schema", "client-library"]
      version: "^2.1.0"
    - project: "design-system"
      artifacts: ["component-library", "tokens"]
      version: "^1.5.0"

  downstream:
    - project: "mobile-app"
      consumes: ["rest-api", "websocket-events"]
    - project: "analytics-dashboard"
      consumes: ["user-events", "metrics"]

coordination:
  sync_meetings:
    frequency: "weekly"
    participants: ["tech-leads", "product-owners"]

  shared_channels:
    slack: "#project-coordination"
    teams: "Project Dependencies"

  automation:
    dependency_checks: true
    breaking_change_alerts: true
    cross_project_testing: true
```

### 2. Agent Sharing Policies

```typescript
interface AgentSharingPolicy {
  // Global shared agents available to all projects
  globalAgents: {
    "security-auditor": {
      quota: "unlimited",
      priority: "high",
      sla: "99.9%"
    },
    "performance-analyzer": {
      quota: "50/hour",
      priority: "medium",
      sla: "99.5%"
    }
  };

  // Project-specific agents with sharing rules
  projectAgents: {
    "e-commerce/payment-processor": {
      shareWith: ["mobile-app", "admin-dashboard"],
      restrictions: ["no-test-data", "audit-required"]
    },
    "mobile/push-notification": {
      shareWith: ["web-app"],
      conditions: ["same-team-only"]
    }
  };

  // Resource allocation rules
  resourceLimits: {
    perProject: {
      cpu: "100 cores",
      memory: "500GB",
      agents: "1000/hour"
    },
    perTeam: {
      cpu: "20 cores",
      memory: "100GB",
      agents: "200/hour"
    }
  };
}
```

### 3. Configuration Management

```yaml
# Global Configuration Template
global:
  claude_flow:
    version: "2.0.0"
    registry: "enterprise.registry.com"

  security:

    audit_logging: true

  monitoring:
    metrics_endpoint: "https://metrics.company.com"
    logging_level: "INFO"
    tracing: true

# Project-Level Overrides
projects:
  e-commerce:
    security:
      audit_logging: "detailed"  # Override for PCI compliance

    performance:
      sla_targets:
        response_time: "100ms"
        throughput: "10000 rps"

    agents:
      custom_types:
        - "payment-processor"
        - "inventory-manager"
        - "fraud-detector"

  mobile-app:
    security:
      device_restrictions: true  # Mobile-specific security

    performance:
      sla_targets:
        response_time: "200ms"
        battery_impact: "minimal"

    agents:
      custom_types:
        - "react-native-builder"
        - "ios-simulator"
        - "android-emulator"
```

## Cross-Team Collaboration Patterns
