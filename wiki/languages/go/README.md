# Go Development with Claude-Flow

A comprehensive guide to Go development using claude-flow-novice agents for accelerated development, testing, and deployment.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize Go project with claude-flow
npx claude-flow-novice sparc run architect "Go microservice with REST API"
npx claude-flow-novice sparc tdd "user authentication service"

# Or use MCP for complex coordination
npx claude-flow-novice mcp swarm_init --topology mesh --max-agents 5
npx claude-flow-novice mcp agent_spawn --type coder --capabilities go,rest-api,testing
```
