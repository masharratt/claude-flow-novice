# Novice Tier Commands

> **5 essential commands to get started with Claude Flow**

The Novice tier is designed for newcomers to Claude Flow. These commands provide a simple, natural language interface with intelligent defaults and guided assistance.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

- **Natural Language First**: Describe what you want in plain English
- **Intelligent Defaults**: System makes smart choices for you
- **Guided Learning**: Each command teaches you something new
- **Safety First**: Built-in protection against common mistakes

## üìã Command Overview

| Command | Purpose | Complexity | Usage Frequency |
|---------|---------|------------|-----------------|
| `init` | Project initialization | ‚≠ê | Once per project |
| `build` | Feature development | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | Daily |
| `status` | Check project health | ‚≠ê | Multiple times daily |
| `help` | Get assistance | ‚≠ê | As needed |
| `learn` | Unlock new features | ‚≠ê | Weekly |

## 1. `claude-flow-novice init`

### Purpose
Initialize a new project with intelligent project detection and setup.

### Syntax
```bash
claude-flow-novice init [project-type] [options]
```

### Options
- `--template <name>` - Use a specific project template
- `--interactive` / `-i` - Interactive setup wizard
- `--skip-git` - Skip Git repository initialization
- `--help` - Show command help

### How It Works
1. **Detects Context**: Analyzes current directory for existing projects
2. **Smart Inference**: Guesses project type from files and dependencies
3. **Creates Structure**: Sets up appropriate folder structure
4. **Configures Environment**: Adds necessary config files
5. **Initializes Git**: Sets up version control (unless skipped)
6. **Generates Starter Code**: Creates basic working examples

### Examples

#### Basic Initialization
```bash
# Let Claude Flow detect and setup everything automatically
claude-flow-novice init

# Output:
# üöÄ Initializing new Claude Flow project...
# üìÅ Created web project structure
# ‚öôÔ∏è Configured development environment
# üîÑ Initialized Git repository
# üé® Generating starter code...
# ‚úÖ Successfully initialized web project!
```

#### Specify Project Type
```bash
# Create a specific type of project
claude-flow-novice init react
claude-flow-novice init "API server"
claude-flow-novice init "mobile app"

# Natural language works too!
claude-flow-novice init "create a todo application"
```

#### Interactive Setup
```bash
# Get guided setup with questions and choices
claude-flow-novice init --interactive

# Example interaction:
# ? What type of project? (Use arrow keys)
# ‚ùØ Web Application (React/Vue/Angular)
#   API/Backend (Express/FastAPI)
#   Mobile App
#   Desktop App
#   Machine Learning
```

### Project Types Supported
- **Web**: React, Vue, Angular applications
- **API**: REST APIs, GraphQL servers
- **Mobile**: React Native, Expo apps
- **Desktop**: Electron applications
- **ML**: Python data science projects

### Common Use Cases

#### 1. Starting Fresh
```bash
# In an empty directory
mkdir my-new-project
cd my-new-project
claude-flow-novice init

# System will ask what you want to build
```

#### 2. Existing Project Enhancement
```bash
# In a project with some files
cd existing-project
claude-flow-novice init

# Detects existing structure and enhances it
```

#### 3. Template-Based Start
```bash
# Use a proven template
claude-flow-novice init --template "e-commerce"
claude-flow-novice init --template "blog"
claude-flow-novice init --template "dashboard"
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Permission Errors
```bash
# If you get permission errors:
sudo claude-flow-novice init --skip-git
# Then initialize git manually later
```

#### Directory Not Empty
```bash
# System will ask before overwriting files
# Choose 'enhance' to add to existing project
# Choose 'backup' to backup and replace
```

#### Git Issues
```bash
# Skip git if having issues
claude-flow-novice init --skip-git
# Initialize git manually later: git init
```

### Success Indicators
- ‚úÖ Project structure created
- ‚úÖ Package.json/requirements.txt created
- ‚úÖ Basic config files added
- ‚úÖ Starter code generated
- ‚úÖ Git repository initialized

### Next Steps After Init
```bash
# Check what was created
claude-flow-novice status

# Start building features
claude-flow-novice build "user authentication"

# Learn more about the system
claude-flow-novice learn
```

## 2. `claude-flow-novice build`

### Purpose
Build features using AI agents with natural language descriptions. The heart of Claude Flow development.

### Syntax
```bash
claude-flow-novice build [feature-description] [options]

### How It Works
1. **Parse Intent**: Understands what you want to build
2. **Analyze Context**: Examines your existing project
3. **Plan Workflow**: Breaks down the task into steps
4. **Select Agents**: Chooses appropriate AI agents
5. **Execute Workflow**: Runs the planned steps
6. **Integrate Results**: Ensures everything works together

### Natural Language Patterns

#    Intent: authentication
#    Domain: frontend
#    Complexity: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (3/5)
#    Estimated Time: 15-20 minutes
#    Confidence: 92%
#
# ü§ñ Recommended Agents:
#    ‚Ä¢ researcher (requirements) - 3 minutes
#    ‚Ä¢ coder (implementation) - 12 minutes
#    ‚Ä¢ tester (validation) - 5 minutes
#
# üìã Workflow Steps:

#    3. ‚ö° Implement authentication logic
#    4. üîÑ Add form validation
#    5. üîÑ Create tests
```

#### Complex Multi-Feature Build
```bash
claude-flow-novice build "create a complete e-commerce product page with cart, reviews, and recommendations"

# System breaks this down into multiple coordinated agents
```

#### Interactive Planning
```bash
claude-flow-novice build --interactive

# Guided conversation:
# ü§î What would you like to build?
# > I want to add user profiles
#
# üéØ I understand you want user profiles. Let me clarify:
# ? Should this include:
#   ‚úì Profile creation/editing
#   ‚úì Avatar upload
#   ‚úì Privacy settings
#   ? Social features (friends, followers)?
```

#### Dry Run (Planning Mode)
```bash
claude-flow-novice build "add shopping cart" --dry-run

# Shows the complete plan without executing:
# üîç Dry run completed - showing planned execution
#
# Planned Workflow:
# 1. Research cart patterns (2 min)
# 2. Create cart component (8 min)
# 3. Implement cart logic (10 min)
# 4. Add persistence (5 min)
# 5. Create tests (7 min)
#
# Total estimated time: 32 minutes
# Required files: 6 new, 3 modified
```

claude-flow-novice status     # Check your progress
claude-flow-novice learn      # See learning opportunities
claude-flow-novice build "something new"  # Apply knowledge
claude-flow-novice help build # Deepen understanding
```

#### Experimentation
```bash
# Try different build patterns:
claude-flow-novice build "create a simple blog"
claude-flow-novice build "add a shopping cart"
claude-flow-novice build "implement user profiles"
claude-flow-novice build "optimize database queries"
```

### Common Questions

#### "How do I unlock new commands?"
Use commands regularly and try different types of features. The system tracks your usage and automatically upgrades your tier when ready.

#### "What should I learn first?"
Focus on the `build` command - it's the most powerful and teaches you the most about how Claude Flow works.

#### "How do I know what's available?"
Use `claude-flow-novice help` to see your current capabilities and `claude-flow-novice learn` to see what's coming next.

#### "Can I speed up progression?"
Quality over quantity - focus on successfully completing diverse tasks rather than repeating the same commands.
