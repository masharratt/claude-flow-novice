3. **Namespace Organization**: Use logical namespaces for different contexts
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Implement memory cleanup procedures
5. **Documentation**: Document memory schemas and usage patterns

### Hook Integration

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Use hooks for task lifecycle events
2. **Progress Reporting**: Regular progress updates via hooks
3. **Error Escalation**: Use hooks for error reporting and escalation
4. **Team Communication**: Leverage hooks for team notifications
5. **Metrics Collection**: Use hooks for automated metrics gathering
