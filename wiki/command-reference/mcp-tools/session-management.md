# Session Management and Coordination

Advanced session management techniques for claude-flow projects using MCP tools and Claude Code integration.

## üéØ Overview

Session management in claude-flow enables:
- **Persistent Context**: Maintain project state across Claude Code sessions
- **Cross-Session Coordination**: Seamless handoffs between team members
- **State Recovery**: Automatic restoration of interrupted work
- **Multi-Project Management**: Switch between projects while preserving context
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared session state for distributed teams

## üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices

### Session Management Guidelines

1. **Session Planning**: Always start with clear goals and expected outcomes
2. **Regular Persistence**: Save session state every 30 minutes minimum
3. **Context Documentation**: Maintain rich context for handoffs and recovery
4. **Blocker Management**: Document and escalate blockers promptly
5. **Quality Gates**: Include quality checks in every session

### Memory Usage Patterns

1. **Consistent Naming**: Use standardized session key naming conventions
2. **Appropriate TTL**: Set proper time-to-live based on session type
3. **Namespace Organization**: Use session-type-specific namespaces
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Implement automatic cleanup of expired sessions
5. **Backup Strategy**: Maintain backups of critical session data

### Coordination Best Practices

1. **Clear Handoffs**: Document comprehensive handoff information
2. **Context Validation**: Verify context restoration before continuing work
3. **Progress Tracking**: Maintain detailed progress and completion tracking
4. **Team Communication**: Use hooks and memory for team coordination
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Analyze session metrics for optimization
