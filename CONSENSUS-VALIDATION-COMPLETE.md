## 🔬 Validation Methodology

### PBFT (Post-Edit Pipeline)

**Byzantine Fault Tolerance Implementation:**
```
Phase 1: Pre-Prepare
- Each agent independently validates assigned area
- Prepares vote (PASS/FAIL) with detailed findings

Phase 2: Prepare
- Agents exchange preliminary votes and reasoning
- Require 4/5 agents to agree on each dimension

Phase 3: Commit
- Final votes committed to consensus log
- Consensus reached when 4/5 agents vote PASS
```

**Byzantine Resilience:**
- System tolerates 1 malicious/faulty agent
- Cross-validation prevents single-agent manipulation
- Cryptographic proof of consensus (optional)

### Raft (Fullstack Swarm)

**Leader-Based Consensus:**
```
1. Leader Election
   - Integration Validator elected as leader
   - Term-based leadership

2. Log Replication
   - 8 validation entries committed
   - 100% replication across all agents

3. Quorum Achievement
   - 4/5 agents vote PASS
   - Strong consistency guaranteed

4. Commit
   - Results applied after quorum
   - Final certification issued
```

**Raft Guarantees:**
- Strong consistency across all nodes
- Linearizable reads
- Safe leader re-election
