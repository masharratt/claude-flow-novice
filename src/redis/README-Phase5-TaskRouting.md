# Phase 5 Task Routing & Resource Management Implementation

## Overview

This implementation delivers an intelligent task routing system and WASM instance pool management for Agent-Booster Integration & Code Performance Acceleration in Phase 5.

## Components Implemented

### 1. CodeTaskRouter (`src/redis/code-task-router.js`)

**Purpose**: Intelligent task routing system for code operations with Redis coordination.

**Key Features**:
- **Task Classification**: Routes based on file-type, operation-type, complexity, and priority
- **Load Balancing**: Implements least-connections, weighted-round-robin, and resource-based strategies
- **Fallback Latency**: <100ms with automatic fallback routing
- **Redis Coordination**: Publishes routing events to "swarm:phase-5:routing" channel
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of agent availability and performance

**Routing Criteria**:
- File types: js, ts, py, rs, go, java, cpp, c
- Operations: create, edit, refactor, test, analyze, optimize
- Complexity levels: simple, medium, complex, critical
- Priority levels: low, normal, high, urgent

### 2. WASMInstancePool (`src/redis/wasm-instance-pool.js`)

**Purpose**: Dynamic pool management for booster instances with auto-scaling.

**Configuration**:
- Min pool size: 2 instances
- Max pool size: 20 instances
- Scale up threshold: 80% utilization
- Scale down threshold: 30% utilization
- Health check interval: 30 seconds

**Key Features**:
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on utilization thresholds
- **Resource Management**: Memory and CPU monitoring per instance
- **Health Monitoring**: Instance health checks and zombie detection
- **Performance Tracking**: Execution time and success rate metrics
- **Redis Coordination**: Status events published to "swarm:phase-5:wasm-status"

**Scaling Behavior**:
- Scale up when utilization > 80% and below max capacity
- Scale down when utilization < 30% and above min capacity
- 60-second cooldown between scaling actions
- Essential instances protected (min pool size)

### 3. WASMErrorHandler (`src/redis/wasm-error-handler.js`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery for WASM instances.

**Error Classification**:
- **Panic/Trap**: WASM runtime panics with restart strategy
- **Memory Errors**: Out of bounds and memory issues with memory increase
- **Timeout**: Execution timeouts with timeout extension
- **Compilation**: WASM compilation errors with interpreter fallback
- **Connection**: Network connectivity issues with reconnection

**Recovery Strategies**:
- **Panic Recovery**: Restart instance, clear memory, validate state
- **Memory Recovery**: Increase memory allocation, cleanup cache
- **Timeout Recovery**: Extend timeout, optimize execution
- **Fallback Activation**: Hand off to regular agents when recovery fails

**Configuration**:
- Max retries: 3 per error
- Exponential backoff with 2x multiplier
- Panic threshold: 5 consecutive panics
- Recovery events to "swarm:phase-5:wasm-recovery"

### 4. TaskRoutingCoordinator (`src/redis/task-routing-coordinator.js`)

**Purpose**: Integration hub coordinating all routing and resource management components.

**Key Features**:
- **Unified Task Execution**: Single entry point for all tasks
- **Component Coordination**: Manages interactions between router, pool, and error handler
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time system status and performance metrics
- **Redis Coordination**: Central coordination channel "swarm:phase-5:coordination"

**Task Flow**:
1. Task validation and capacity check
2. Route task via CodeTaskRouter
3. Execute in WASM pool or regular agents
4. Handle errors with WASMErrorHandler
5. Update statistics and emit events

**Configuration**:
- Max concurrent tasks: 50
- Task timeout: 5 minutes
- Monitoring interval: 30 seconds
