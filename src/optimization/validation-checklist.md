## Testing Requirements

### Performance Tests
```bash
# Basic performance validation
npm run test:performance

# Expected results:
# - Average latency: <10ms ✅
# - P95 latency: <10ms ✅
# - Throughput: >10k ops/sec ✅ (initial target)
# - Success rate: >95% ✅
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Stage 3 unified system validation
node scripts/validate-stage3-performance.ts

# Expected results:
# - Agent spawn time: <50ms ✅
# - Communication latency: <5ms ✅
# - 100+ agents supported ✅
# - System stability: Good ✅
```

### Load Tests
```bash
# Sustained load testing
npm test -- tests/integration/stage3-unified-system.test.ts

# Test scenarios:
# 1. Single agent spawn (verify <10ms)
# 2. 100 agent parallel spawn (verify <5s total)
# 3. High message throughput (10k msgs/sec for 60s)
# 4. Sustained operation (100 agents for 5 min)
```

### Stress Tests
```bash
# Production validation
npm run test:production

# Stress scenarios:
# 1. Max concurrent agents (200+)
# 2. Peak message load (50k+ msgs/sec)
# 3. Long-running stability (24hr test)
# 4. Resource exhaustion recovery
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Known Risks
1. **TypeScript Compilation Issues**
   - Status: Pre-existing (BigInt target, readonly properties)
   - Impact: Low (runtime should work)
   - Mitigation: Test runtime behavior

2. **Async Race Conditions**
   - Status: Mitigated (setImmediate maintains order)
   - Impact: Low
   - Mitigation: Integration tests verify correctness

3. **Performance Regression**
   - Status: Unlikely (targeted optimizations)
   - Impact: Medium if occurs
   - Mitigation: Before/after benchmarks

### Rollback Plan
If performance targets not met:
1. Revert specific optimization (granular changes)
2. Run validation again
3. Identify problematic change
4. Re-implement with different approach

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Today)
1. [ ] Run `npm run test:performance`
2. [ ] Run `node scripts/validate-stage3-performance.ts`
3. [ ] Document actual vs expected results
4. [ ] Identify any gaps

### Short-term (This Week)
1. [ ] Run full integration test suite
2. [ ] Perform load testing
3. [ ] Validate 100+ agent scenarios
4. [ ] Update metrics baselines

### Medium-term (Next Sprint)
1. [ ] Implement binary serialization if needed
2. [ ] Add object pooling if GC overhead observed
3. [ ] Enable zero-copy buffers for large payloads
4. [ ] Performance regression testing in CI/CD
