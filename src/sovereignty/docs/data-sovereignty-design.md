# Data Sovereignty & Geographic Controls Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive data sovereignty and geographic controls system designed to ensure compliance with multi-national data protection regulations.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Geographic Data Routing System

**Core Principles:**
- Data residency enforcement through geographic routing
- Strict blocking of unauthorized cross-border transfers
- Real-time compliance validation
- Individual data access audit trails

**Supported Regions:**
- European Union (EU)
- United States (US)
- Asia-Pacific (APAC)
- Canada
- Australia

### 2. Data Flow Architecture

```
Request → Geographic Detection → Routing Rules → Compliance Check → Data Access
    ↓               ↓                    ↓              ↓              ↓
  IP/Location    Regional Mapping     Sovereignty    Real-time     Audit Logging
  Analysis       to Data Centers      Validation     Monitoring     & Alerting
```

### 3. Enforcement Levels

**Strict Blocking Mode:**
- Complete prevention of unauthorized data transfers
- Zero-tolerance approach to compliance violations
- Immediate blocking of suspicious activities
- Real-time alerting on potential violations

### 4. Regional Compliance Framework

#### European Union (EU)
- **Regulation:** GDPR
- **Requirements:** Data residency within EU/EEA
- **Transfer Mechanisms:** Adequacy decisions, Standard Contractual Clauses
- **Audit Requirements:** Individual data access logging

#### United States (US)
- **Regulation:** CCPA (California), various state laws
- **Requirements:** Data localization for specific sectors
- **Transfer Mechanisms:** Privacy Shield frameworks
- **Audit Requirements:** Consumer data access tracking

#### Asia-Pacific (APAC)
- **Regulations:** PDPA (Singapore), PIPEDA (variants)
- **Requirements:** Regional data storage requirements
- **Transfer Mechanisms:** Binding Corporate Rules
- **Audit Requirements:** Cross-border transfer logging

#### Canada
- **Regulation:** PIPEDA
- **Requirements:** Data residency for sensitive information
- **Transfer Mechanisms:** Adequacy assessments
- **Audit Requirements:** Consent and access logging

#### Australia
- **Regulation:** Privacy Act
- **Requirements:** Data localization for government data
- **Transfer Mechanisms:** Privacy Principles compliance
- **Audit Requirements:** Data breach notification logging

### 5. Technical Implementation

#### Geographic Detection
- IP-based geolocation with 99.5% accuracy
- User-declared location verification
- Device location validation (mobile)
- Multi-factor location confirmation

#### Routing Rules Engine
- Configurable regional policies
- Dynamic rule updates via Redis
- Fallback mechanisms for edge cases
- Performance-optimized rule matching

#### Compliance Monitoring
- Real-time compliance score calculation
- Automated violation detection
- Escalation procedures for violations
- Compliance reporting dashboard

### 6. Redis Coordination Architecture

#### Channels Used:
- `swarm:phase-3:sovereignty` - Main coordination
- `sovereignty:compliance:alerts` - Compliance violations
- `sovereignty:routing:updates` - Rule changes
- `sovereignty:audit:logs` - Audit trail updates

#### Memory Structure:
```
swarm:phase3:sovereignty:rules:{region} - Regional routing rules
swarm:phase3:sovereignty:compliance:{user_id} - User compliance status
swarm:phase3:sovereignty:audit:{timestamp} - Audit log entries
swarm:phase3:sovereignty:stats:{region} - Regional statistics
```

### 7. Performance Considerations

#### Throughput Requirements:
- 10,000+ requests per second
- Sub-100ms compliance decision time
- 99.99% system availability
- Real-time audit trail updates

#### Scalability Features:
- Horizontal scaling of routing nodes
- Redis cluster for high availability
- Geographic distribution of enforcement points
- Load balancing across regional validators

### 8. Security Implementation

#### Encryption Standards:
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive transfers
- Key management via HSM integration

#### Access Controls:
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication for admin access
- API rate limiting and throttling
- IP whitelisting for privileged operations

### 9. Monitoring & Alerting

#### Key Metrics:
- Compliance score per region
- Data transfer volume by geography
- Violation detection rate
- System response times

#### Alert Thresholds:
- Compliance score < 95%
- Unauthorized transfer attempts
- System performance degradation
- Audit log anomalies

### 10. Integration Points

#### External Systems:
- Identity Provider (IdP) integration
- Cloud provider regional APIs
- Compliance monitoring tools
- Legal/regulatory update services

#### Internal Systems:
- Application layer data access
- Database regional distribution
- CDN geographic routing
- Analytics and reporting systems
