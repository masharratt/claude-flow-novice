## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### With SDK Integration
**Development:** 1-2 weeks × $150/hr × 40 hrs = $6,000 - $12,000
**Maintenance:** Minimal (Anthropic-maintained)
**Token Costs:** 80-90% reduction via optimization
**Year 1 Total:** ~$20,000 + optimized token costs

### Without SDK (Custom Implementation)
**Development:** 2-3 months × $150/hr × 160 hrs = $48,000 - $72,000
**Maintenance:** 20% annually = $9,600 - $14,400
**Token Costs:** Depends on optimization quality
**Year 1 Total:** ~$70,000 - $100,000 + token costs

**ROI:** $50,000 - $80,000 saved in first year alone
