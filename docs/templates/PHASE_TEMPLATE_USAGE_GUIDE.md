# Phase Document Template - Usage Guide

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-10-02

---

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the `PHASE_DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE.md` to create structured phase documents for your implementation roadmap.

## Quick Start

1. **Copy the template**:
   ```bash
   cp docs/templates/PHASE_DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE.md docs/phases/PHASE_X_NAME.md
   ```

2. **Fill in placeholders** (search for `[` to find all):
   - `[NUMBER]` - Phase number (0, 1, 2, etc.)
   - `[PHASE NAME]` - Descriptive phase name
   - `[YYYY-MM-DD]` - Actual dates
   - `[Description]` - Detailed descriptions

3. **Review Phase 0 example**: See `/docs/phases/PHASE_0_SDK_FOUNDATION.md` for complete reference

4. **Run post-edit hook**:
   ```bash
   node src/hooks/enhanced-post-edit-pipeline.js post-edit "docs/phases/PHASE_X_NAME.md" \
     --memory-key "phase-X/planning" --structured
   ```

## Template Sections Explained

### 1. Phase Overview

**Purpose**: Provide context and positioning within the broader roadmap

**Key Components**:
- **Previous Phase**: What was just completed (enables understanding dependencies)
- **Current Phase**: What you're documenting now
- **Next Phase**: What comes after (shows how current phase enables future work)

**Timeline Table**:
```markdown
| Milestone | Target Date | Dependencies | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Phase kickoff | YYYY-MM-DD | Phase X complete | ‚è≥ |
```

**Scope Boundaries**: Clearly define what IS and ISN'T included to prevent scope creep

---

### 2. Objectives

**Primary Objectives** (3-5 objectives):
```markdown
1. **[Objective Category]**: [Objective Description]
   - **Rationale**: Why this objective matters
   - **Impact**: What this enables downstream
   - **Measurement**: How success is quantified
```

**Guidelines**:
- Focus on **outcomes**, not activities
- Each objective should have measurable criteria
- Link to success criteria section

**Secondary Objectives**: Nice-to-haves if time permits

---

### 3. Success Criteria

**All criteria must be BINARY (yes/no) and measurable**

**Four Categories**:

#### Functional Criteria (F1, F2, F3...)
Features and capabilities that must work:
```markdown
| F1 | Spawn 20 agents in <2 seconds | <2s latency | `npm run benchmark:spawn` | ‚è≥ |
```

#### Performance Criteria (P1, P2, P3...)
Speed, resource usage, scalability:
```markdown
| P1 | Agent spawn latency | <100ms (p95) | `benchmark.js` suite | ‚è≥ |
```

#### Quality Criteria (Q1, Q2, Q3...)
Code quality, testing, security:
```markdown
| Q1 | Test coverage | ‚â•80% | `npm run test:coverage` | ‚è≥ |
```

#### Validation Criteria (V1, V2, V3...)
Integration, compatibility, consensus:
```markdown
| V1 | Byzantine consensus | ‚â•90% agreement | Validator swarm | ‚è≥ |
```

**Best Practices**:
- Always include test coverage (‚â•80%)
- Always include security audit
- Always include Byzantine consensus for critical phases
- Provide exact measurement commands

---

### 4. Deliverables

**Each deliverable needs**:
- Description (what's being built)
- Components (files/modules)
- Acceptance tests (how to validate)
- Expected outputs (artifacts)
- Dependencies (prerequisites)
- Status (‚è≥/üîÑ/‚úÖ)

**Example Structure**:
```markdown
#### Deliverable 1: [Name]

**Description**: [What's being delivered]

**Components**:
- Component 1: `/path/to/file1.ts`
- Component 2: `/path/to/file2.ts`

**Acceptance Tests**:
\`\`\`bash
npm run test:deliverable1:unit
npm run test:deliverable1:integration
\`\`\`

**Expected Outputs**:
- Artifact 1: Working API endpoint
- Artifact 2: Documentation

**Dependencies**: [Prerequisites]

**Status**: ‚è≥ Not Started
```

**Documentation Deliverables**:
- API Documentation (D1)
- Architecture Documentation (D2)

---

### 5. Developer Assignments

**Team Structure**:
- Phase Lead: Overall coordination
- Core Developers: Implementation

**Per Developer**:
```markdown
### Developer 1: [Name]

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Deliverable X: [Component]
- Deliverable Y: [Component]

**Workload Estimate**: [X hours]

**Key Tasks**:
1. Task 1: [Description] - [Est. hours]
2. Task 2: [Description] - [Est. hours]

**Files/Components**:
- `/path/to/component1.ts`
- `/path/to/component2.ts`

**Dependencies**:
- Requires Developer 2 to complete [task] first
```

**Guidelines**:
- Assign specific files/components to each developer
- Estimate hours per task
- Document dependencies between developers
- Identify blockers early

---

### 6. Dependencies

**Three Categories**:

#### Phase Dependencies
```markdown
| Dependency | Type | Status | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|-----------|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Phase X complete | Internal | ‚úÖ Complete | Low | N/A |
| Component Y | Internal | üîÑ In Progress | Medium | Parallel work |
| Library Z | External | ‚è≥ Pending | High | Alternative identified |
```

#### Technical Dependencies
- Required for phase start
- Required for phase completion

#### Blocker Management
- Current blockers
- Blocker resolution process
- Escalation path

---

### 7. Risks & Mitigations

**High-Priority Risks** (detailed):
```markdown
#### Risk 1: [Risk Name]

**Probability**: High | Medium | Low
**Impact**: High | Medium | Low
**Overall Risk Score**: [Probability √ó Impact]

**Description**: [What could go wrong]

**Indicators** (early warning signs):
- Sign 1
- Sign 2

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Proactive action 1
2. Proactive action 2

**Contingency Plan** (if risk occurs):
1. Immediate action
2. Escalation path
3. Alternative approach

**Owner**: [Developer Name]
**Status**: ‚è≥ Monitoring
```

**Medium-Priority Risks** (table format):
```markdown
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|-------|
| [Risk 3] | Medium | Medium | [Brief mitigation] | [Name] |
```

---

### 8. Testing Requirements

**Coverage Targets**:
```markdown
| Test Type | Coverage Target | Current | Status |
|-----------|----------------|---------|--------|
| Unit tests | ‚â•80% | 0% | ‚è≥ |

- ‚úÖ **Complete**: Finished successfully
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **At Risk**: Potential issues detected
- üö´ **Blocked**: Cannot proceed without resolution

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Criteria Measurable
**Bad**: "Improve performance"
**Good**: "Agent spawn latency <100ms (p95) measured by benchmark.js"

### 2. Define Clear Test Commands
Every success criterion should have an exact test command:
```bash
npm run test:unit:phase-0         # Runs unit tests
npm run benchmark:spawn           # Tests spawn performance
npm run test:coverage             # Checks coverage threshold
```

### 3. Document Dependencies Early
Identify blockers BEFORE they block:
- Technical dependencies
- Inter-developer dependencies
- External team dependencies

### 4. Risk Management
- Identify risks during planning (not during execution)
- Assign owners to each risk
- Create contingency plans proactively
- Monitor indicators weekly

### 5. Consensus Validation
Always include Byzantine consensus for:
- Architectural changes
- Security-critical features
- Performance-sensitive code
- Major refactors

### 6. Progressive Documentation
Update phase document as work progresses:
- Update status symbols daily
- Track actual vs. planned hours
- Document issues as discovered
- Update completion checklist continuously

---

## Example: Creating Phase 1

```bash
# Step 1: Copy template
cp docs/templates/PHASE_DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE.md docs/phases/PHASE_1_CLI_MODE.md

# Step 2: Fill in placeholders
# Search for [ and replace:
# - [NUMBER] ‚Üí 1
# - [PHASE NAME] ‚Üí CLI Mode Implementation
# - Previous Phase ‚Üí Phase 0: SDK Foundation
# - Next Phase ‚Üí Phase 2: SDK Mode Implementation

# Step 3: Add specific deliverables
# - Deliverable 1: Process Pool Manager
# - Deliverable 2: File-based State System
# - Deliverable 3: SIGSTOP/SIGCONT Pause/Resume

# Step 4: Define success criteria
# - F1: Spawn 20 agents in <2 seconds via process pool
# - P1: Process pool initialization <50ms
# - Q1: Test coverage ‚â•80%

# Step 5: Assign developers
# - Developer 1: Process Pool Manager
# - Developer 2: State Management
# - Developer 3: Testing & Documentation

# Step 6: Run validation
node src/hooks/enhanced-post-edit-pipeline.js post-edit \
  "docs/phases/PHASE_1_CLI_MODE.md" \
  --memory-key "phase-1/planning" \
  --structured
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Vague Success Criteria
**Wrong**:
```markdown
| F1 | System works well | Good performance | Manual testing | ‚è≥ |
```

**Right**:
```markdown
| F1 | Spawn 20 agents | <2s total time | `npm run benchmark:spawn` | ‚è≥ |
```

### 2. Missing Acceptance Tests
Every deliverable must have executable acceptance tests:
```bash
npm run test:deliverable1:unit
npm run test:deliverable1:integration
npm run validate:deliverable1
```

### 3. Undefined Dependencies
Always document:
- What must be complete before starting
- What must be complete before finishing
- Developer-to-developer dependencies

### 4. No Risk Mitigation
Don't just list risks - include:
- Early warning indicators
- Proactive mitigation strategies
- Contingency plans if risk occurs

### 5. Incomplete Checklist
Phase completion checklist must cover:
- Functional completion
- Quality assurance
- Documentation
- Consensus validation
- Deployment readiness
- Handoff preparation
