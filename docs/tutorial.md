Welcome to Claude Flow Novice! This tutorial will guide you through your first AI agent automation experience.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Basic command line knowledge
- A curious mind about AI automation!

## Chapter 1: Your First Agent

### What You'll Learn
- How to create a project
- What agents do
- How to run your first automation

### Step 1: Install Claude Flow Novice

```bash
npm install -g claude-flow-novice
```

### Step 2: Create Your First Project

```bash
claude-flow-novice init my-first-ai-project

## Chapter 3: Building Your First Workflow

### The Magic of Combining Agents

Real power comes from using multiple agents together. Let's build a complete project workflow.

### Project: Build a Simple Website

#### Step 1: Plan the Project
```bash
claude-flow-novice init website-project
cd website-project

claude-flow-novice agent create planner "Plan a simple personal portfolio website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"
claude-flow-novice run
```

#### Step 2: Research Best Practices
```bash
claude-flow-novice agent create researcher "Research modern web development best practices for portfolio sites"
claude-flow-novice run
```

#### Step 3: Write the Code
```bash
claude-flow-novice agent create coder "Build the HTML structure and CSS styling for the portfolio website based on the plan"
claude-flow-novice run

claude-flow-novice agent create coder "Add JavaScript interactivity to the portfolio website"
claude-flow-novice run
```

#### Step 4: Review the Work
```bash
claude-flow-novice agent create reviewer "Review the portfolio website code for best practices and improvements"
claude-flow-novice run
```

#### Step 5: Check Your Progress
```bash
claude-flow-novice status
claude-flow-novice agent list
```

## Chapter 4: Advanced Techniques

### Running Multiple Agents at Once

You can create multiple agents and run them all together:

```bash
# Create multiple agents
claude-flow-novice agent create researcher "Research e-commerce website features"
claude-flow-novice agent create planner "Plan an e-commerce site architecture"
claude-flow-novice agent create coder "Design database schema for products and users"

# Run all pending agents
claude-flow-novice run
```

### Iterative Development

Use agent results to improve your work:

```bash
# Initial implementation
claude-flow-novice agent create coder "Create a login form in React"
claude-flow-novice run

# Review and improve
claude-flow-novice agent create reviewer "Review the login form for security and usability"
claude-flow-novice run

# Make improvements based on review
claude-flow-novice agent create coder "Improve the login form based on the security review feedback"
claude-flow-novice run
```

### Project Management

Keep track of your work:

```bash
# Check overall project status
claude-flow-novice status

# List all agents and their current state
claude-flow-novice agent list

# Remove agents you no longer need
claude-flow-novice agent remove <agent-id>
```

## Chapter 5: Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Learning a New Technology

```bash
claude-flow-novice init learning-docker
cd learning-docker

# Research phase
claude-flow-novice agent create researcher "Research Docker fundamentals and main use cases"
claude-flow-novice agent create researcher "Find the best Docker tutorials for beginners"

# Planning phase
claude-flow-novice agent create planner "Create a 30-day learning plan for mastering Docker"

# Practical phase
claude-flow-novice agent create coder "Create a simple Dockerfile for a Node.js application"

# Run all agents
claude-flow-novice run
```

### Example 2: Building a Side Project

```bash
claude-flow-novice init task-manager-app
cd task-manager-app

# Discovery and planning
claude-flow-novice agent create researcher "Research popular task management app features"
claude-flow-novice agent create planner "Design the architecture for a task management web app"

# Implementation
claude-flow-novice agent create coder "Create the backend API for task management with Node.js"
claude-flow-novice agent create coder "Build the frontend UI with React"

# Quality assurance
claude-flow-novice agent create reviewer "Review the entire task management app for improvements"

claude-flow-novice run
```

### Example 3: Content Creation

```bash
claude-flow-novice init blog-content
cd blog-content

# Research trending topics
claude-flow-novice agent create researcher "Research trending topics in web development for 2024"

# Plan content strategy
claude-flow-novice agent create planner "Create a content calendar for tech blog posts"

# Create content
claude-flow-novice agent create coder "Write a beginner-friendly blog post about React hooks"

# Review content
claude-flow-novice agent create reviewer "Review the blog post for clarity and accuracy"

claude-flow-novice run
```

## Chapter 6: Tips for Success

### Writing Good Task Descriptions

**‚úÖ Good:**
- "Research the top 5 JavaScript frameworks and compare their pros and cons"
- "Create a responsive navigation component in React with mobile menu"
- "Review this authentication code for security vulnerabilities"

**‚ùå Avoid:**
- "Do research" (too vague)
- "Make a website" (too broad)
- "Fix the code" (no context)

### Organizing Your Projects

- Use descriptive project names
- One project per main goal or feature
- Remove old agents you no longer need
- Check status regularly

### Building on Results

- Read agent outputs carefully
- Use results from one agent to inform the next
- Don't be afraid to iterate and improve
- Ask agents to build on previous work
