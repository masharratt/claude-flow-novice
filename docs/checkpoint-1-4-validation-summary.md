     this.performanceCache.delete(key);
     this.emit('cacheInvalidated', { key, timestamp: new Date() });
   }
   ```

2. **Add Runtime Agent Access Controls**
   ```typescript
   async spawnAgent(agentType: string): Promise<Agent | null> {
     if (!this.isAgentAllowed(agentType)) {
       throw new AgentAccessDeniedError(`Agent not available at current level`);
     }
     return this.createAgent(agentType);
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Consent Flow**
   ```typescript
   async requireConsent(feature: string): Promise<boolean> {
     if (this.isDangerousFeature(feature)) {
       return await this.showConsentDialog(feature);
     }
     return true;
   }
   ```
