2. Verify Auto Scaling Group health
3. Review recent deployments
4. Check database connectivity

**Mitigation Steps:**
1. Roll back recent deployment if needed
2. Scale up healthy instances
3. Restart services if required
4. Fail over to DR region if necessary

**Escalation Triggers:**
- Service not restored within 30 minutes
- Multiple components failing simultaneously
- Unknown root cause after 15 minutes

### 2. Database Performance Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Slow response times
- Database connection timeouts
- High CPU/memory usage on database

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check database performance metrics
2. Review slow query logs
3. Verify connection pool status
4. Check replication lag

**Mitigation Steps:**
1. Kill long-running queries
2. Scale up database instance
3. Optimize problematic queries
4. Fail over to read replica if needed

**Escalation Triggers:**
- Database unavailable for > 10 minutes
- Data corruption suspected
- Replication failure

### 3. Security Incident

**Symptoms:**
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Security alert triggers
- Data breach indicators

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Preserve evidence
3. Change credentials
4. Enable additional logging

**Mitigation Steps:**
1. Block malicious IP addresses
2. Patch vulnerabilities
3. Review access logs
4. Notify security team

**Escalation Triggers:**
- Confirmed data breach
- System compromise confirmed
- Regulatory notification required

### 4. Auto Scaling Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Insufficient capacity
- Instances failing to launch
- Scaling policies not working
- High load on existing instances

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check Auto Scaling Group status
2. Review scaling policies
3. Verify resource limits
4. Check launch configuration

**Mitigation Steps:**
1. Manually scale up instances
2. Fix launch configuration issues
3. Adjust scaling thresholds
4. Request service limit increases

**Escalation Triggers:**
- Auto Scaling completely non-functional
- Resource limits blocking scaling
- Multiple scaling failures

## Decision Trees

### Service Restoration Decision Tree

```
START: Service outage detected
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Can you identify the root cause?
â”‚  â”œâ”€ YES â†’ Implement specific fix
â”‚  â”‚     â”œâ”€ Fix successful? â†’ YES â†’ Monitor and document
â”‚  â”‚     â””â”€ Fix successful? â†’ NO â†’ Escalate to SEV2
â”‚  â””â”€ NO â†’ Try generic fixes
â”‚        â”œâ”€ Rollback last deployment
â”‚        â”œâ”€ Restart services
â”‚        â””â”€ Scale up infrastructure
â”‚              â”œâ”€ Services restored? â†’ YES â†’ Monitor and investigate
â”‚              â””â”€ Services restored? â†’ NO â†’ Initiate failover
```

### Failover Decision Tree

```
START: Considering failover
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Is primary region completely down?
â”‚  â”œâ”€ YES â†’ Execute failover immediately
â”‚  â””â”€ NO â†’ Continue evaluation
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Is DR region healthy and synchronized?
â”‚  â”œâ”€ YES â†’ Failover is viable
â”‚  â””â”€ NO â†’ Failover not possible, focus on primary recovery
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Will failover cause data loss?
â”‚  â”œâ”€ YES â†’ Get management approval
â”‚  â””â”€ NO â†’ Proceed with failover
â”‚
â””â”€ Is failover time < acceptable downtime?
   â”œâ”€ YES â†’ Execute failover
   â””â”€ NO â†’ Continue primary recovery efforts
```
