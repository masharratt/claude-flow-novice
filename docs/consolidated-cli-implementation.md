## Core Components

### 1. TierManager (Progressive Disclosure)

**Purpose**: Manages the 3-tier command progression system
**Key Features**:
- Tracks user progress and command usage
- Automatically upgrades users based on proficiency
- Provides tier-specific command availability

```typescript
enum UserTier {
  NOVICE = 'novice',      // 5 essential commands
  INTERMEDIATE = 'intermediate', // +10 commands (15 total)
  EXPERT = 'expert'       // Full 112-tool access
}
```

**Progression Logic**:
- **Novice → Intermediate**: 10+ commands used, 4+ unique commands, 80%+ success rate
- **Intermediate → Expert**: 25+ commands used, 10+ unique commands, 85%+ success rate

### 2. IntelligenceEngine (Smart Analysis)

**Purpose**: Analyzes tasks and selects optimal agents automatically
**Key Features**:
- Natural language processing for task interpretation
- Intelligent agent recommendation based on complexity and domain
- Project context detection and framework-specific optimization

**Analysis Pipeline**:
1. Parse natural language input
2. Classify domain (frontend, backend, testing, etc.)
3. Assess complexity (1-5 scale)
4. Recommend agents based on tier and requirements
5. Generate optimized workflow

### 3. CommandHandlers (Core 5 Commands)

**The Essential Commands**:

1. **`init`** - Initialize projects with intelligent defaults
   - Natural language project descriptions
   - Framework detection and setup
   - Intelligent directory structure creation

2. **`build`** - Build features using AI agents
   - Natural language feature descriptions
   - Automatic agent selection and workflow generation
   - Parallel execution for complex tasks

3. **`status`** - Monitor project and system health
   - Project context analysis
   - User progression tracking
   - Performance metrics

4. **`help`** - Contextual help and guidance
   - Interactive help sessions
   - Command-specific assistance
   - Progressive feature discovery

5. **`learn`** - Unlock features and advance tiers
   - Interactive learning paths
   - Topic-specific tutorials
   - Tier progression guidance

### 4. CommandRouter (Backward Compatibility)

**Purpose**: Routes commands while maintaining backward compatibility
**Key Features**:
- Legacy command mapping to new consolidated commands
- Natural language command interpretation
- Intelligent suggestions for unknown commands

**Legacy Mapping Examples**:
```typescript
'sparc tdd' → 'build with test-driven development'
'swarm-init' → 'init with team collaboration'
'agent-spawn' → 'agents spawn' (Intermediate+ tier)
```

### 5. PerformanceOptimizer (Speed Optimization)

**Purpose**: Ensures <2s command execution through optimization
**Key Features**:
- Intelligent caching with TTL and LRU eviction
- Parallel agent execution
- Preloading of common data patterns
- Memory management and cleanup

**Performance Targets**:
- Command response: <2s average
- Agent spawning: <1s for simple tasks
- Cache hit rate: >80%
- Memory usage: <100MB baseline

## Implementation Highlights

### Natural Language Processing

The system interprets natural language commands through pattern matching and intent analysis:

```typescript
// Examples of natural language interpretation
"create a todo app with React" → init command with React template
"add user authentication" → build command with auth agents
"setup testing" → build command with testing workflow
```

### Intelligent Defaults

Context-aware defaults based on:
- Project type detection (web, api, mobile, desktop, ml)
- Framework identification (React, Vue, Express, FastAPI, etc.)
- User preferences and history
- Best practices for each domain

### Progressive Disclosure

Users start with 5 simple commands and unlock more based on usage:

```
Tier 1 (Novice): 5 commands
├── Natural language support
├── Automatic agent selection
├── Guided workflows
└── Basic help system

Tier 2 (Intermediate): +10 commands
├── Direct agent control
├── Advanced testing
├── Deployment automation
└── Performance optimization

Tier 3 (Expert): Full access
├── All 112 tools
├── Custom workflows
├── Enterprise features
└── Advanced integrations
```

## Key Innovations
