# Fleet Manager Architecture Design

## Overview

The Fleet Manager is a comprehensive system for orchestrating and managing 1000+ AI agents in a distributed swarm environment. It provides centralized coordination with intelligent resource allocation, agent discovery, and health monitoring capabilities.

## Architecture Components

### 1. FleetCommanderAgent

**Purpose**: Central fleet coordinator responsible for:
- Managing up to 1000 concurrent agents
- Coordinating 16 different agent pool types
- Priority-based resource allocation
- Health monitoring and recovery
- Redis pub/sub coordination

**Key Specifications**:
- Max agents: 1000
- Pool types: 16 (coder, tester, reviewer, architect, researcher, analyst, optimizer, security, performance, ui, mobile, devops, database, network, infrastructure, coordinator)
- Allocation strategy: Priority-based with dynamic scaling
- Heartbeat interval: 5000ms
- Redis coordination: All fleet operations via pub/sub

### 2. Agent Registry

**Purpose**: Central repository for agent registration and discovery:
- Agent lifecycle management
- Capability tracking
- Performance metrics
- Health status monitoring
- Dynamic scaling support

### 3. Resource Allocation System

**Purpose**: Intelligent resource distribution:
- Priority-based task assignment
- Load balancing across pools
- Dynamic scaling based on demand
- Resource pool management
- Performance optimization

## Data Structures

### Agent Configuration
```javascript
{
  id: "agent-uuid",
  type: "coder|tester|reviewer|...",
  pool: "pool-type",
  status: "idle|active|busy|failed|recovering",
  priority: 1-10,
  capabilities: ["javascript", "testing", "api"],
  performance: {
    tasksCompleted: 0,
    avgTaskTime: 0,
    successRate: 0,
    lastActive: timestamp
  },
  health: {
    lastHeartbeat: timestamp,
    failures: 0,
    recoveryAttempts: 0
  },
  resources: {
    memory: 0,
    cpu: 0,
    network: 0
  }
}
```

### Pool Configuration
```javascript
{
  type: "coder|tester|...",
  minAgents: 5,
  maxAgents: 100,
  currentAgents: 0,
  priorityLevel: 1-10,
  scalingEnabled: true,
  resourceLimits: {
    memory: 512MB,
    cpu: 0.5,
    network: 100Mbps
  }
}
```

## Redis Pub/Sub Channels

### Fleet Management
- `swarm:phase-1:fleet` - Fleet status and coordination
- `swarm:phase-1:registry` - Agent registry updates
- `swarm:phase-1:health` - Health monitoring
- `swarm:phase-1:allocation` - Resource allocation updates
- `swarm:phase-1:scaling` - Scaling events

### Agent Communication
- `swarm:phase-1:agent:{agentId}` - Individual agent communication
- `swarm:phase-1:pool:{poolType}` - Pool-specific communication
- `swarm:phase-1:tasks` - Task distribution
- `swarm:phase-1:results` - Task results

## Performance Requirements

### Scalability
- Support 1000+ concurrent agents
- <50ms response time for fleet operations
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Resource usage optimization

### Reliability
- 99.9% uptime requirement
- Automatic failover and recovery
- Health monitoring with 5-second intervals
- Circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance

### Performance
- <100ms agent registration time
- <200ms task allocation time
- <10ms fleet status queries
- Real-time monitoring capabilities

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Agent identity verification
- Secure communication channels
- Role-based access control
- Token-based authentication

### Resource Protection
