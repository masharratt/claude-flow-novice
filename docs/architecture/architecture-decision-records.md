## ADR-003: Multi-Tier Storage with Hierarchical Override

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-09-25
**Deciders**: Storage Team, DevOps Team

### Context

Different users and organizations have varying storage requirements: individual developers need local configuration, teams need shared settings, enterprises need compliance and auditability, and organizations need policy enforcement.

### Decision

We will implement a **hierarchical storage system with four tiers** that cascade configuration with proper override semantics.

**Storage Tiers** (lowest to highest precedence):
1. **Local Storage** (`~/.claude-flow/config.json`): User-specific preferences
2. **Project Storage** (`.claude-flow/config.json`): Project-specific settings
3. **Team Storage** (Git repository/cloud): Shared team configuration
4. **Cloud Storage**: Cross-device synchronization and backup

**Override Behavior**:
- Higher tiers override lower tiers for conflicting values
- Configuration merges intelligently (objects merge, primitives override)
- Policy enforcement at team/organization level
- Conflict resolution with user prompts when needed

### Rationale

1. **Supports All Use Cases**: Individual, team, and enterprise scenarios
2. **Familiar Model**: Similar to Git config, CSS cascade, and other hierarchical systems
