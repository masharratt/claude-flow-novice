- **Low Pressure**: Easy to dismiss or postpone
- **Preview Option**: Quick look without commitment

### Stage 2: First Experience (Days 2-3)

**Guided Trial:**
```
🎓 Let's try validation with a simple task

We'll guide you through using validation on a
completed task to see how it works.

Current task: "Update project documentation"
✅ Marked complete 5 minutes ago

What validation will check:
• Did you address all documentation sections?
• Are the changes clear and helpful?
• Is the information accurate and current?

This takes about 30 seconds and you can see
exactly what we're checking.

[Start Validation] [Choose Different Task] [Skip for Now]
```

**Key Features:**
- **Safe Environment**: Using already-completed work
- **Transparent Process**: Shows exactly what's being checked
- **Quick Experience**: Under 30 seconds for first try
- **User Choice**: Multiple options to proceed

### Stage 3: Understanding Results (Days 3-5)

**Results Presentation:**
```
🔍 Validation Results: Looking Good!

Your documentation update passes validation ✅

What we checked:
✅ All required sections updated
✅ Changes clearly explained
✅ Information appears accurate
⚠️  Consider adding an update date

🎯 Your validation score: 85% (Great work!)

This means your task meets our quality standards
and is ready for others to use.

The suggestion above could make it even better,
but it's already good to go as-is.
