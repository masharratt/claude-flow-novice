## 🤖 Step 3: Launch Your First Agent Swarm

Now for the exciting part! Let's tell AI agents what to build:

```bash
claude-flow-novice swarm "Create a todo app with user authentication"
```

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. **🎯 Task Analysis**: Claude Flow analyzes your request
2. **🤖 Agent Spawning**: Creates specialized AI agents:
   - Backend Developer (API, database)
   - Frontend Developer (user interface)
   - Security Specialist (authentication)
   - Tester (quality assurance)
3. **📋 Planning**: Agents collaborate on project architecture
4. **💻 Implementation**: Agents start building components
5. **🧪 Testing**: Automated testing and validation
6. **📊 Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking

### Watch the Magic Happen

You'll see output like this:
```
🚀 Initializing swarm: todo-app-development
🤖 Spawning agents: backend-dev, frontend-dev, security-specialist, tester
📋 Planning project architecture...
💻 Building backend API...
🎨 Creating frontend components...
🔒 Implementing authentication...
🧪 Running tests...
📊 Progress: 25% ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
```

---

## 📊 Step 4: Monitor Progress

While the agents work, you can monitor their progress in real-time:

```bash
# Open the monitoring dashboard
claude-flow-novice monitor
```

The dashboard shows:
- **Active Agents**: What each AI agent is doing right now
- **Progress Bar**: Overall project completion percentage
- **Code Generation**: See code being written in real-time
- **Test Results**: Quality metrics and test coverage
- **Agent Chat**: How agents collaborate and make decisions

### Dashboard Features
- 📈 **Real-time Progress**: Watch your app being built
- 💬 **Agent Communications**: See how agents coordinate
- 📝 **Code Preview**: Review generated code instantly
- ✅ **Quality Metrics**: Track testing and validation
- 🔄 **Error Handling**: Automatic fixes and retries

---

## 🎯 Step 5: Review the Results

Once the swarm completes, you'll have:

### Generated Backend
```bash
# Check what was created
ls src/
# You should see: api/, models/, middleware/, routes/

# Start the backend server
npm start
# Usually runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### Generated Frontend
```bash
# Frontend files
ls src/components/
# You should see: Login.jsx, TodoList.jsx, Dashboard.jsx

# Start frontend (if React/Vue app)
npm run dev
# Usually runs on http://localhost:5173
```

### Test Results
```bash
# Run the generated tests
npm test

# View test coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## 🛠️ Step 6: Customize and Extend

Your basic todo app is ready! Now you can customize it:

### Add New Features
```bash
# Add due dates to todos
claude-flow-novice swarm "Add due dates and reminders to the todo app"

# Add categories
claude-flow-novice swarm "Add categories and filtering to todos"
```

### Modify Existing Code
```bash
# Change the UI theme
claude-flow-novice swarm "Update the UI to use dark mode with blue accents"

# Add mobile responsiveness
claude-flow-novice swarm "Make the todo app mobile-responsive"
```
