**Security Measures:**
- Path validation with allowlisted extensions
- Base path restrictions
- No dynamic file inclusion vulnerabilities

### 4. Command Injection Protection ✅ **SECURE**

**Analysis:**
- All `spawn()` calls use `shell: false` option (secure)
- Proper input validation before command execution
- No use of dangerous functions like `exec()` with user input
- Arguments are properly escaped and validated
- Process spawning is contained and secure

**Key Findings:**
- Hook system uses secure process spawning
- CLI commands properly validate input parameters
- No evidence of shell injection vulnerabilities

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization ✅ **SECURE**

**Analysis:**
- Comprehensive input validation using Joi and Zod schemas
- Proper sanitization of user inputs
- Command line argument parsing with validation
- Schema-based configuration validation
- Type checking and boundary validation

**Validation Patterns:**
- CLI arguments are properly parsed and validated
- Configuration files use schema validation
- API inputs are sanitized before processing

### 6. Configuration Security ✅ **SECURE**

**Analysis:**
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Proper use of environment variables
- Example `.env` files provided without real secrets
- Secure defaults for production environments
- Configuration validation with schema enforcement

**Configuration Practices:**
- JWT secrets use strong placeholder values
- Database connection strings use environment variables
- API keys and sensitive data properly externalized

### 7. Network Communications ✅ **SECURE**

**Analysis:**
- HTTPS/TLS enforcement in production configurations
- Proper CORS configuration with origin restrictions
- Rate limiting implemented
- Security headers (Helmet) integration
- WebSocket security measures in place

**Network Security Features:**
- TLS 1.3 support
- CORS with allowlisted origins
- Rate limiting with configurable thresholds
- Security headers for XSS/CSRF protection

### 8. Access Control & Authorization ✅ **SECURE**

**Analysis:**
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Granular permission system
- Proper authorization checks at API endpoints
- Session-based access control
- Administrative privilege separation

**Access Control Features:**
- 5 distinct user roles (admin, operator, developer, viewer, service)
- 13 granular permissions
- Middleware-based authorization checks
- Session validation and cleanup

### 9. Error Handling & Information Disclosure ✅ **SECURE**

**Analysis:**
- Proper error handling without sensitive information disclosure
- Structured error types with appropriate abstraction
- Logging without credential exposure
- Stack traces properly managed
- Error boundaries prevent information leakage

**Error Security Features:**
- Custom error classes with safe serialization
- Sanitized error messages for external consumers
- Comprehensive logging with security filters
- No database connection strings or secrets in error messages

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### ✅ **Cryptography & Hashing**
- JWT signing with HMAC-SHA256
- bcrypt for password hashing with configurable rounds
- Secure random token generation using `nanoid`
- Constant-time comparison for cryptographic operations

### ✅ **Process Security**
- All child processes spawn with `shell: false`
- Proper argument sanitization
- Process isolation and containment
- Secure inter-process communication

### ✅ **Data Protection**
