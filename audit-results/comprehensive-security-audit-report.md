## Detailed Security Assessment by Component

### Agent Isolation Security ✅ GOOD (Risk: 3.5/10)

**Strengths**:
- Proper process separation through child_process spawning
- Enhanced cleanup with SIGTERM/SIGKILL handling
- Cross-platform process management
- Prevention of zombie processes

**Weaknesses**:
- No container-based isolation
- Limited explicit resource limits
- No namespace isolation

**Recommendation**: Implement container-based isolation for production

### Permission and Access Control ⚠️ MEDIUM RISK (Risk: 6.0/10)

**Strengths**:
- Excellent JWT token validation implementation
- Redis-based token blacklisting
- Comprehensive role-based access control
- Proper user validation and account status checking

**Weaknesses**:
- Command line argument injection vulnerabilities
- Insufficient security logging for failed attempts
- No input validation for process arguments
- Silent error handling in optional authentication

**Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive input validation and security logging

### Resource Limits and Security Boundaries ❌ HIGH RISK (Risk: 8.5/10)

**Critical Gaps**:
- No memory limits enforced on agent processes
- No CPU time restrictions implemented
- No disk I/O quotas or file system restrictions
- No network access controls or isolation
- No container-based resource isolation

**Security Implications**:
- Resource exhaustion attacks possible
- Unlimited system access for malicious agents
- No protection against runaway processes
- Potential for system denial of service

**Recommendation**: Immediate implementation of container-based isolation with comprehensive resource monitoring

### Credential Isolation ❌ CRITICAL RISK (Risk: 9.2/10)

**Critical Failures**:
- Environment variables expose JWT_SECRET to all processes
- No per-agent credential scoping
- Secrets stored as plaintext in memory
- No secret rotation or expiration policies
- Potential secret leakage through logging

**Attack Vectors**:
- Process inspection reveals all secrets
- Memory dumps expose credentials
- Error logs may contain sensitive data
- Cross-agent credential access possible

**Recommendation**: Complete redesign with encrypted secret storage and agent isolation

### Cleanup Process Security ⚠️ MEDIUM RISK (Risk: 6.5/10)

**Strengths**:
- Robust process termination handling
- Multiple signal handler implementation
- Prevention of zombie processes

**Weaknesses**:
- No secure memory wiping implemented
- No systematic temporary file cleanup
- Missing secure file deletion procedures
- Potential sensitive data persistence

**Recommendation**: Implement secure data sanitization procedures

### MCP Function Vulnerabilities ❌ CRITICAL RISK (Risk: 9.5/10)

**Critical Security Failures**:
- 63 total vulnerabilities identified
- 16 critical command injection vulnerabilities
- No authentication required for most functions
- Direct system command execution possible
- Path traversal vulnerabilities in file operations
- XSS injection possible in browser functions

**High-Risk Functions**:
- `terminal_execute`: Direct command injection
- `swarm_destroy`: No auth for critical operations
- `browser_evaluate`: Script injection vulnerabilities
- File system functions: Path traversal attacks

**Recommendation**: Immediate disable of all MCP functions until security controls implemented
