  # Ubuntu: sudo apt install redis-server
  # Windows: Download from redis.io
  ```

---

## 🎮 Basic Examples

### Example 1: Build a Web API
```bash
# Launch a development swarm
claude-flow-novice swarm "Create a REST API for managing user tasks"
```

**What happens automatically:**
1. 🤖 Spawns specialized agents (backend, API designer, tester)
2. 📋 Plans the API endpoints and structure
3. 💻 Builds the API with best practices
4. 🧪 Runs tests and validation
5. 📊 Shows you progress in real-time

### Example 2: Frontend Development
```bash
# Create a React application
claude-flow-novice swarm "Build a React dashboard with user login and charts"
```

**AI agents will coordinate to:**
- Set up React project structure
- Design component architecture
- Implement user authentication
- Add data visualization
- Create responsive design
- Run comprehensive tests

### Example 3: Research & Analysis
```bash
# Market research
claude-flow-novice swarm "Research the best Node.js frameworks for building APIs"
```

**Research agents will:**
- Gather information about popular frameworks
- Compare features and performance
- Analyze pros and cons
- Create a summary report
- Provide recommendations

## 🎯 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

```
You Tell AI What to Build
          ↓
    Claude Flow Creates
    Specialized AI Agents
          ↓
    Agents Work Together
    (Like a Team of Experts)
          ↓
    You Monitor Progress
    In Real-time Dashboard
          ↓
    Complete Project ✅
```

### The AI Agent Types
- **Backend Developer** - Builds APIs, databases, server logic
- **Frontend Developer** - Creates user interfaces, React/Vue apps
- **Tester** - Writes tests, finds bugs, ensures quality

## 🔧 Simple Configuration

Most users don't need to configure anything - it works out of the box! But if you want to customize:

### Basic Config File
Create `claude-flow.config.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "maxAgents": 5,
  "redis": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 6379
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables (Optional)
```bash
# Redis settings
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# API keys (if using external services)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Logging level
LOG_LEVEL=info
```
