# Phase 6: Configuration Directory Structure

## Overview

Phase 6 creates a centralized configuration directory structure to improve project organization and prepare for future configuration migrations.

## Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

### Context
The project currently has configuration files scattered throughout the repository:
- TypeScript configs in root and various subdirectories
- Jest configuration embedded in package.json
- ESLint and Prettier configs in root
- Build tool configurations mixed with source code

This scattered approach makes configuration management difficult and reduces maintainability.

### Decision
Create a centralized `config/` directory with subdirectories organized by tool type:

```
config/
├── typescript/     # TypeScript compiler configurations
├── jest/          # Jest testing framework configurations
├── linting/       # ESLint, Prettier, and linting tools
├── build/         # Build tool configurations (Babel, SWC, etc.)
└── apps/          # Application-specific configurations
```

### Rationale

**Benefits:**
1. **Improved Organization**: Clear separation of configuration concerns
2. **Better Maintainability**: Easier to locate and update specific configurations
3. **Enhanced Reusability**: Configurations can be shared across projects
4. **Future Scalability**: Structure supports potential monorepo architecture
5. **Developer Experience**: Reduced cognitive load when working with configurations
6. **Consistency**: Follows industry best practices for configuration management

**Trade-offs:**
1. **Migration Effort**: Existing tools may need path updates
2. **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand new structure
3. **Tool Compatibility**: Some tools may have expectations about config locations

### Consequences
- Future phases will migrate existing configurations into this structure
- Build scripts and development tools will need path updates
- Documentation will need updates to reflect new locations
- The config/apps/ directory may be subject to review in Phase 10

## Implementation Details

### Directory Creation
Created the following directory structure:
- `config/typescript/` - For tsconfig.json files and TypeScript project references
- `config/jest/` - For Jest configuration files and test setup utilities
- `config/linting/` - For ESLint, Prettier, and other code quality tools
- `config/build/` - For Babel, SWC, webpack, and other build tool configurations
- `config/apps/` - For application-specific configuration overrides

### Documentation
- Added `config/README.md` explaining the structure and purpose
- Created this phase documentation for architectural decisions

## Next Steps

Future phases will:
1. **Phase 7**: Migrate TypeScript configurations to `config/typescript/`
2. **Phase 8**: Move Jest configurations to `config/jest/`
3. **Phase 9**: Relocate linting configurations to `config/linting/`
4. **Phase 10**: Review and potentially restructure app-specific configs
5. **Phase 11**: Update build tool configurations in `config/build/`

## Quality Attributes Addressed

### Maintainability
- Centralized configuration management
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent organization pattern

### Scalability
- Structure supports project growth
- Enables easy addition of new configuration types
- Prepares for potential monorepo architecture

### Developer Experience
- Reduced time to locate configurations
- Clear mental model of where configurations belong
- Improved onboarding for new team members

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: Tool Path Dependencies
**Mitigation**: Carefully update tool references during migration phases

### Risk: Team Adoption
**Mitigation**: Clear documentation and gradual migration approach

### Risk: Configuration Conflicts
**Mitigation**: Thorough testing during each migration phase

## Success Metrics

- All configuration types have dedicated directories
- Configuration files are easily discoverable
- Reduced time spent searching for configuration files
- Consistent configuration organization across the project
