# Dashboard Real-time Display Fixes - Implementation Report

## Overview

Successfully resolved the premium dashboard frontend real-time display issues by implementing comprehensive fixes for CSP restrictions, Socket.io CDN blocking, and HTTP polling fallback mechanisms. The dashboard now provides reliable real-time updates with WebSocket connections and robust fallback options.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. CSP Policy Blocking Socket.io CDN
- **Problem**: Content Security Policy prevented loading Socket.io from CDN
- **Solution**: Implemented self-hosted Socket.io client library at `/socket.io.js`
- **Result**: ‚úÖ CSP-compliant real-time connections without external dependencies

### 2. WebSocket Connection Failures
- **Problem**: WebSocket connections failing due to authentication and security restrictions
- **Solution**: Enhanced authentication handling and connection error recovery
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Reliable WebSocket connections with automatic reconnection

### 3. Missing HTTP Polling Fallback
- **Problem**: No fallback mechanism when WebSocket connections fail
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive `HttpPollingService` with retry logic
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Seamless fallback to HTTP polling with 1-second intervals
