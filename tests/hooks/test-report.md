## Recommendations

### Failed Tests

**Rust Enforcement:**

- Filter false positives (comments): Command failed: node /mnt/c/Users/masha/Documents/claude-flow-novice/config/hooks/post-edit-pipeline.js /mnt/c/Users/masha/Documents/claude-flow-novice/test-files/rust-comments.rs --rust-strict --structured


**Integration Tests:**

- Error reporting: Should have reported error

- Multiple flags combined: Not all flags applied


### Skipped Tests

Some tests were skipped due to missing dependencies or test frameworks. Consider installing:
