# Autonomous CFN Loop Test Scenario

## Test Objective
Validate that the CFN Loop operates fully autonomously, self-correcting and progressing through phases without requiring user approval at decision gates.

---

## Test Scenario: JWT Authentication Implementation

### Scenario Overview
Implement complete JWT authentication system across 3 phases with autonomous progression and self-correction.

**Total Expected Turns**: 8-12 (depending on failures)
**User Interventions Required**: 0
**Success Criteria**: Full implementation with ≥90% consensus approval

---

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 0: Foundation (Database Schema)
**Deliverables**: User table, migration scripts, database connection
**Agents**: 3 (backend-dev, database-architect, tester)
**Expected Loops**: 2-3

### Phase 1: Core Authentication
**Deliverables**: Login/register endpoints, password hashing, JWT generation
**Agents**: 4 (backend-dev, security-specialist, api-docs, tester)
**Expected Loops**: 2-4

### Phase 2: Token Management
**Deliverables**: Refresh token flow, token revocation, session management
**Agents**: 5 (backend-dev, security-specialist, system-architect, api-docs, tester)
**Expected Loops**: 3-5

## Expected Autonomous Execution Flow

### Turn 1: Phase 0 - First Attempt (Self-Assessment FAIL)

```
[Claude Initialize]
📋 Initializing CFN Loop for JWT Authentication
→ Starting Phase 0: Database Foundation
→ Spawning 3-agent swarm (mesh topology)

[Swarm Execution]
✅ Agent 1 (backend-dev): Schema created - Confidence: 75%
⚠️ Agent 2 (database-architect): Migration scripts incomplete - Confidence: 68%
✅ Agent 3 (tester): Basic tests passing - Confidence: 80%

[Self-Assessment Gate]
📊 Average Confidence: 74.3% (Threshold: 75%)
❌ FAIL: Below confidence threshold

[Autonomous Decision]
🔄 Round 1 failed. Retrying NOW with feedback.
→ No user approval required (Round 1/10)
→ Feedback: "Migration scripts need rollback handling and data validation"
```

**Key Behavior**: Claude IMMEDIATELY retries without asking "Should I proceed?"

---

### Turn 2: Phase 0 - Second Attempt (Consensus FAIL)

```
[Swarm Execution - Round 2]
✅ Agent 1 (backend-dev): Enhanced schema - Confidence: 92%
✅ Agent 2 (database-architect): Complete migrations - Confidence: 88%
✅ Agent 3 (tester): Comprehensive tests - Confidence: 85%

[Self-Assessment Gate]
📊 Average Confidence: 88.3% (Threshold: 75%)
✅ PASS: Proceeding to consensus validation

[Consensus Validation]
Spawning 3-validator swarm:
  - Validator 1 (reviewer): Quality review
  - Validator 2 (security-specialist): Security audit
  - Validator 3 (system-architect): Architecture validation

[Byzantine Consensus Results]
✅ Validator 1: APPROVE (90% confidence)
⚠️ Validator 2: REJECT (Index missing on email column - security concern)
✅ Validator 3: APPROVE (88% confidence)

📊 Consensus: 67% approval (Threshold: 90%)
❌ FAIL: Below consensus threshold

[Autonomous Decision]
🔄 Round 2 failed consensus. Retrying NOW with validator feedback.
→ No user approval required (Round 2/10)
→ Critical Fix: "Add unique index on users.email for security"
```

**Key Behavior**: Claude IMMEDIATELY retries with validator feedback without waiting

---

### Turn 3: Phase 0 - Third Attempt (SUCCESS)

```

```

**Key Behavior**: Claude IMMEDIATELY transitions to Phase 1 without asking permission

---

### Turn 4: Phase 1 - First Attempt (Self-Assessment FAIL)

```
[Claude Continue]
📋 Phase 1: Core Authentication
→ Spawning 4-agent swarm (mesh topology)

[Swarm Execution]
✅ Agent 1 (backend-dev): Login endpoint created - Confidence: 78%
⚠️ Agent 2 (security-specialist): Password hashing weak (bcrypt rounds=10) - Confidence: 65%
✅ Agent 3 (api-docs): OpenAPI spec complete - Confidence: 82%
✅ Agent 4 (tester): Integration tests passing - Confidence: 80%

[Self-Assessment Gate]
📊 Average Confidence: 76.25% (Threshold: 75%)
⚠️ Security concern flagged: bcrypt rounds insufficient

[Autonomous Decision]
🔄 Round 1 failed security validation. Retrying NOW.
→ No user approval required (Round 1/10)

[Phase Completion]
✅ Phase 1 complete (2 rounds)
💾 Results stored in SwarmMemory

[Autonomous Transition]
🎯 Phase 1 COMPLETE. Transitioning to Phase 2 NOW.
→ Starting Phase 2: Token Management
```

---

### Turn 6-8: Phase 2 Execution (Similar Pattern)

```
[Claude Continue]
📋 Phase 2: Token Management
→ Spawning 5-agent swarm (mesh topology)

[Expected Pattern]
- Round 1: FAIL (refresh token storage design issue)
  → Autonomous retry with feedback
- Round 2: FAIL (token rotation logic incomplete)
  → Autonomous retry with validator feedback
- Round 3: SUCCESS (all validations pass)
  → Autonomous completion

[Final Status]
✅ All 3 phases complete
📊 Total iterations: 8 rounds across 3 phases
⏱️ Completion time: 8 turns (no user delays)
🎯 Final consensus: 93% average approval
```

## Validation Criteria

### ✅ Autonomous Behaviors (REQUIRED)

1. **Self-Correction Loop**
   - ✅ Automatically retries on confidence <75%
   - ✅ Automatically retries on consensus <90%
   - ✅ Injects feedback from validators
   - ✅ No "Should I retry?" questions

2. **Phase Transitions**
   - ✅ Automatically progresses to next phase on success
   - ✅ No "Shall I continue?" questions
   - ✅ Immediate continuation without waiting

3. **Error Handling**
   - ✅ Self-diagnoses failures
   - ✅ Applies corrections automatically
   - ✅ Escalates only on critical errors (Round 10+)

4. **Progress Communication**
   - ✅ Reports status: "Retrying NOW (Round 3/10)"
   - ✅ Shows metrics: "Confidence: 88%, retrying"
   - ✅ No approval-seeking language

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ INCORRECT Behaviors (Human-in-Loop)

```
❌ "Consensus failed at 86%. Would you like me to retry?"
❌ "Phase 0 complete. Shall I proceed to Phase 1?"
❌ "Low confidence detected. Awaiting your decision."
❌ "Max iterations reached. Stopping and waiting for instructions."
❌ "Validator rejected changes. What should I do?"
❌ "Should I continue with the next phase?"
```

### ✅ CORRECT Behaviors (Autonomous)

```
✅ "Consensus failed (86%). Retrying NOW with feedback (Round 2/10)."
✅ "Phase 0 complete. Transitioning to Phase 1 immediately."
✅ "Low confidence (72%). Relaunching agents with corrective actions."
✅ "Round 3/10 - Applying validator feedback and retrying."
✅ "Security issue detected. Self-correcting and revalidating."
✅ "All phases complete. Final consensus: 93%. Implementation successful."
```

## Implementation Notes

### CFN Loop Decision Logic

```javascript
// Autonomous decision tree (no human intervention)
async function autonomousDecisionGate(round, confidence, consensus) {
  // Self-Assessment Gate
  if (confidence < 0.75) {
    console.log(`🔄 Round ${round}/10 - Low confidence (${confidence}%). Retrying NOW.`);
    return injectFeedbackAndRetry(round + 1);
  }

  // Consensus Gate
  const validationResult = await spawnConsensusSwarm();
  if (validationResult.consensus < 0.90) {
    console.log(`🔄 Round ${round}/10 - Consensus failed (${consensus}%). Retrying NOW.`);
    return injectValidatorFeedbackAndRetry(round + 1);
  }

  // Success - Auto-transition
  if (hasNextPhase()) {
    console.log(`✅ Phase complete. Transitioning to next phase NOW.`);
    return executeNextPhase();
  }

  // All phases complete
  console.log(`✅ All phases complete. Final consensus: ${consensus}%.`);
  return { status: 'success', metrics: gatherMetrics() };
}

// No user approval checkpoints - fully autonomous
```

  📋 Initializing CFN Loop: JWT Authentication
  🔄 Phase 0 Round 1/10 - Confidence: 74% (FAIL) - Retrying NOW

Turn 2:
  🔄 Phase 0 Round 2/10 - Confidence: 88% → Consensus: 67% (FAIL) - Retrying NOW

Turn 3:
  ✅ Phase 0 complete (93% consensus) - Transitioning to Phase 1 NOW

Turn 4:
  🔄 Phase 1 Round 1/10 - Security issue detected - Retrying NOW

Turn 5:
  ✅ Phase 1 complete (92% consensus) - Transitioning to Phase 2 NOW

Turn 6:
  🔄 Phase 2 Round 1/10 - Confidence: 76% (FAIL) - Retrying NOW

Turn 7:
  🔄 Phase 2 Round 2/10 - Consensus: 85% (FAIL) - Retrying NOW

Turn 8:

  ✅ ALL PHASES COMPLETE - Implementation successful
```

**Key Observation**: No user approval prompts throughout entire execution.

## Conclusion

This test scenario validates that the CFN Loop operates as a **fully autonomous system** that:

1. Self-corrects on failures
2. Retries with injected feedback
3. Transitions phases automatically
4. Only escalates on critical errors (Round 10+)
5. Never requires user approval at decision gates

**Success = Zero user interventions from start to finish.**
