# üîÑ [2/5] Architecture Design (system-architect) - Running...
# ‚è∏Ô∏è [3/5] Backend Implementation (backend-dev) - Waiting
# ‚è∏Ô∏è [4/5] Frontend Implementation (coder) - Waiting
# ‚è∏Ô∏è [5/5] Integration Testing (tester) - Waiting
```

### Schedule Maintenance Workflow

# Output:
# üìã Scheduled: maintenance-pipeline
# ‚è∞ Next run: Monday, 2:00 AM UTC
# üîÑ Tasks: dependency-updates, security-scan, cleanup
# üìä Estimated duration: 15-20 minutes
```
