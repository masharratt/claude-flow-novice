```bash
# Search codebase for patterns
grep -r "pattern" --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" src/

# Analyze project structure
find . -type f -name "*.json" | head -20

# Web research for latest information
WebSearch "framework comparison 2024 performance benchmarks"
```

### 2. Analysis Framework
- **Context Analysis**: Understand the problem domain and constraints
- **Source Evaluation**: Assess credibility and relevance of information sources
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare multiple options with pros/cons
