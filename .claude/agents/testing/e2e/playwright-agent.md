# Playwright E2E Testing Agent

## Agent Type: `playwright-tester`

### Primary Function
Automated end-to-end testing agent specialized in web portal testing using Playwright framework with MCP server integration.

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. **Web Portal Testing**
```javascript
// Example test coordination
npx claude-flow-novice sparc run playwright-tester "Test user authentication flow"
```

#### 2. **MCP Integration Testing**
- Test MCP server connectivity
- Validate command execution via web interface
- Monitor real-time agent coordination
- Verify swarm status updates

#### 3. **Cross-Browser Testing**
```typescript
// Multi-browser test execution
const browsers = ['chromium', 'firefox', 'webkit'];
await Promise.all(browsers.map(browser => runTests(browser)));
```

#### 4. **Performance Testing**
- Page load time validation
- Network request monitoring
- Resource usage analysis
- Concurrent operation testing

### Coordination Patterns

#### Pre-Task Hook Integration
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "E2E test execution"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-restore --session-id "e2e-testing"
```

#### Test Execution Workflow
1. **Initialize Test Environment**
   - Start web portal server
   - Connect to MCP servers
   - Setup test data

2. **Execute Test Suites**
   - Web portal functionality tests
   - MCP integration tests
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Accessibility validation

3. **Report Generation**
   - HTML test reports
   - Screenshot captures
   - Video recordings
   - Performance metrics

#### Memory Coordination
```bash
# Store test results in swarm memory
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "test-results.html" --memory-key "swarm/e2e/results"

# Share test status with other agents
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --message "E2E tests completed - 95% pass rate"
```

### Configuration Files

#### Playwright Config: `config/playwright.config.ts`
- Multi-browser setup
- Web server integration
- Screenshot/video capture
- Retry logic

#### Test Specifications
- `tests/e2e/web-portal.spec.ts` - Main portal functionality
- `tests/e2e/playwright-mcp.spec.ts` - MCP integration tests

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Test Execution
```bash
npm run test:e2e:playwright
```

#### Interactive Testing
```bash
npm run test:e2e:playwright:ui
```

#### Debug Mode
```bash
npm run test:e2e:playwright:debug
```

#### Code Generation
```bash
npm run playwright:codegen
```

### Agent Coordination Protocol

#### 1. **Pre-Execution Phase**
- Coordinate with `web-portal-agent` to ensure server is running
- Sync with `mcp-integration-agent` for server status
- Check memory for previous test results

#### 2. **Execution Phase**
- Run tests in parallel across browsers
- Monitor MCP server responses
- Capture performance metrics
- Store intermediate results

#### 3. **Post-Execution Phase**
- Generate comprehensive reports
- Update swarm memory with results
- Trigger notifications for failures
- Coordinate with `reviewer-agent` for analysis

### MCP Command Mappings

#### Playwright MCP Server Commands
```json
{
  "playwright_navigate": "Navigate to URL",
  "playwright_click": "Click element",
  "playwright_type": "Type text into element",
  "playwright_screenshot": "Take screenshot",
  "playwright_get_title": "Get page title",
  "playwright_get_url": "Get current URL",
  "playwright_wait_for_element": "Wait for element",
  "playwright_evaluate": "Execute JavaScript"
}
```

### Performance Targets

#### Load Time Benchmarks
- Initial page load: < 3 seconds
- First contentful paint: < 2.5 seconds
- Time to interactive: < 4 seconds

#### Test Execution Metrics
- Test suite completion: < 10 minutes
- Browser startup: < 30 seconds
- Parallel test efficiency: > 80%

### Error Handling

#### Network Failures
- Automatic retry logic (3 attempts)
- Graceful degradation for offline scenarios
- Connection timeout handling (30 seconds)

#### Test Failures
- Screenshot capture on failure
- Video recording for complex scenarios
- Detailed error logging with stack traces
- Integration with CI/CD reporting

### Integration with Other Agents

#### `mcp-integration-agent`
- Server health monitoring
- Command validation
- Performance optimization

#### `performance-analyzer`
- Metric collection and analysis
- Bottleneck identification
- Optimization recommendations

#### `reviewer-agent`
- Test result analysis
- Quality assessment
- Improvement suggestions

### Environment Variables

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=true
PLAYWRIGHT_TIMEOUT=30000
PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_WIDTH=1280
PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_HEIGHT=720
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS=chromium,firefox,webkit
```

### Best Practices

1. **Test Organization**
   - Group related tests in describe blocks
   - Use clear, descriptive test names
   - Implement proper setup and teardown

2. **Element Selection**
   - Prefer data-testid attributes
   - Use semantic selectors when possible
   - Avoid brittle CSS selectors

3. **Waiting Strategies**
   - Use Playwright's built-in waiting mechanisms
   - Avoid hard-coded timeouts
   - Wait for network idle when appropriate

4. **Test Data Management**
   - Use fixtures for consistent test data
   - Clean up test data after execution
   - Isolate tests from each other

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues
- **Browser not found**: Run `npm run playwright:install`
- **Timeout errors**: Increase timeout values in config
- **Element not found**: Check selectors and timing
- **Network issues**: Verify server is running

#### Debug Commands
```bash
# Run specific test with debug
npx playwright test web-portal.spec.ts --debug

# Generate test code interactively
npx playwright codegen http://localhost:3000

# Show test trace
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

### Reporting

#### HTML Reports
- Automatic generation after test runs
- Interactive test result exploration
- Screenshot and video attachments
- Performance timeline analysis

#### CI/CD Integration
- JUnit XML output for CI systems
- GitHub Actions integration
- Slack/Teams notifications
- Performance regression alerts
