## Quick Start

### The Three Golden Rules

1. **Complexity-Verbosity Inverse Law**: As task complexity increases, prompt verbosity should DECREASE
2. **Priming Paradox**: Verbose prompts excel at basic tasks, minimal prompts excel at complex reasoning
3. **Rust Validation**: These findings are validated for Rust; hypotheses for other languages

### Format Selection in 30 Seconds

```yaml
Is the task BASIC (parsing, simple logic, CRUD)?
  ‚Üí Use CODE-HEAVY format (+43% quality improvement)

Is the task COMPLEX with clear requirements (architecture, review)?
  ‚Üí Use MINIMAL format (avoid over-constraining)

Is the task MEDIUM complexity with structured steps?
  ‚Üí Use METADATA format (structured guidance)
```

**For detailed format guidance:** See [Format Selection Principles](./agent-principles/format-selection.md)

## Core Universal Principles

### 1. Agent Profile Structure **REQUIRED FORMAT**

Every agent MUST include:

#### Frontmatter (YAML)

```yaml
---
name: agent-name                    # REQUIRED: Lowercase with hyphens
description: |                      # REQUIRED: Clear, keyword-rich description
  MUST BE USED when [primary use case].
  Use PROACTIVELY for [specific scenarios].
  ALWAYS delegate when user asks [trigger phrases].
  Keywords - [comma-separated keywords for search]
tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, TodoWrite, mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init, mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn]  # REQUIRED: Comma-separated list, can include MCP commands
model: sonnet                       # REQUIRED: sonnet | opus | haiku
color: seagreen                     # REQUIRED: Visual identifier
type: specialist                    # OPTIONAL: specialist | coordinator | swarm
capabilities:                       # OPTIONAL: Array of capability tags
  - rust
  - error-handling
lifecycle:                          # OPTIONAL: Hooks for agent lifecycle
  pre_task: "npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task"
  post_task: "npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task"
hooks:                             # OPTIONAL: Integration points
  memory_key: "agent-name/context"
  validation: "post-edit"
triggers:                          # OPTIONAL: Automatic activation patterns
  - "build rust"
  - "implement concurrent"
constraints:                       # OPTIONAL: Limitations and boundaries
  - "Do not modify production database"

#### Body Structure

```markdown
# Agent Name

[Opening paragraph: WHO you are, WHAT you do]

## üö® MANDATORY POST-EDIT VALIDATION

**CRITICAL**: After **EVERY** file edit operation, you **MUST** run:

```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit [FILE_PATH] --memory-key "agent/step" --structured
```

### 2. The Complexity-Verbosity Inverse Law

**Empirical Finding:** Task complexity and prompt verbosity have an inverse relationship.

```
Basic Tasks (parsing, CRUD):
  - Code-Heavy: 85.3% quality (+43% vs Minimal)
  - Best approach: Detailed examples with step-by-step guidance

Complex Tasks (architecture, lock-free algorithms):
  - Minimal: 87.2% quality (+31% vs Code-Heavy)
  - Best approach: High-level principles with reasoning freedom
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Basic tasks benefit from concrete patterns (priming effect)
- Complex tasks need creative freedom (over-specification creates tunnel vision)
- Medium tasks need structured scaffolding without over-constraining

**For detailed analysis:** See [Format Selection Principles](./agent-principles/format-selection.md)

---

### 3. Mandatory Post-Edit Validation

**UNIVERSAL REQUIREMENT:** Every agent MUST run post-edit hooks after file modifications.

```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit [FILE_PATH] \
  --memory-key "agent-name/context" \
  --structured
```

**Benefits:**
- TDD compliance verification
- Security analysis (XSS, eval(), hardcoded credentials)
- Formatting validation
- Test coverage analysis
- Cross-agent memory coordination
- Actionable recommendations

**For integration details:** See [Prompt Engineering Best Practices](./agent-principles/prompt-engineering.md)

---

### 4. Integration with Claude Flow

#### Hook System

Every agent integrates with:
- **Pre-task hooks**: Initialize context, set up memory namespace
- **Post-edit hooks**: Validate quality, coordinate with other agents
- **Post-task hooks**: Finalize task, export metrics
- **Session management**: Persist state across sessions

#### Memory Coordination

```javascript
// Memory key pattern: {agent-type}/{domain}/{aspect}
"architect/auth/design"
"coder/auth/implementation"
"reviewer/auth/feedback"
"tester/auth/coverage"
```

#### Swarm Coordination

When spawning multiple agents:
1. Run pre-task hook
2. Execute work
3. Run post-edit hook for each file
4. Store results in memory
5. Run post-task hook

**For detailed integration:** See [Prompt Engineering Best Practices](./agent-principles/prompt-engineering.md)

## Agent Profile Structure

### The Three Formats

1. **MINIMAL (200-400 lines)**: For complex, strategic tasks requiring reasoning freedom
2. **METADATA (400-700 lines)**: For medium complexity with structured workflows
3. **CODE-HEAVY (700-1200 lines)**: For basic tasks benefiting from concrete examples

**Detailed format specifications:** [Format Selection Principles](./agent-principles/format-selection.md)

# System Architect Agent

You are a senior system architect with deep expertise in designing
scalable, maintainable, and robust software systems.

## üö® MANDATORY POST-EDIT VALIDATION

After EVERY file edit:
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit [FILE] --memory-key "architect/step" --structured
```

## Core Responsibilities

- Design system architectures from business requirements
- Make strategic technical decisions with clear rationale
- Define component boundaries and interactions
- Ensure scalability, security, and maintainability
- Create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Architectural Approach

### Requirements Analysis
Extract functional and non-functional requirements, identify constraints
and quality attributes, understand stakeholder needs.

### Design Process
Apply appropriate patterns (microservices, event-driven, CQRS), consider
trade-offs, document decisions with ADRs.

### Quality Attributes
- Performance: Response times, throughput
- Scalability: Horizontal and vertical scaling
- Security: Zero-trust, defense-in-depth
- Maintainability: Modular design, clear interfaces
- Reliability: Fault tolerance, disaster recovery

## Collaboration

- Work with Coder agents for implementation guidance
- Coordinate with Reviewer agents for design validation
- Provide specifications to DevOps for infrastructure
- Share ADRs via memory system

## Success Metrics

- Architecture meets quality attributes
- Team can implement the design
- Documentation is clear and comprehensive
- Trade-offs are explicitly documented
```

### Example 2: Metadata Format (Medium Tasks)

**For complete example:** See API Developer template in [Format Selection Principles](./agent-principles/format-selection.md)

### Example 3: Code-Heavy Format (Basic Tasks)

**For complete example:** See Rust Coder template in [Format Selection Principles](./agent-principles/format-selection.md)

---

## Specialized Guidance

### By Agent Type

Different agent types have different format requirements:

- **Coder Agents**: Code-Heavy for basic tasks, Minimal for complex algorithms
- **Reviewer Agents**: Minimal format (requires contextual reasoning)
- **Architect Agents**: Minimal format (strategic thinking)
- **Tester Agents**: Code-Heavy for unit tests, Metadata for test strategy
- **Researcher Agents**: Minimal format (open-ended exploration)
- **DevOps Agents**: Metadata format (structured workflows)

**Full type-specific guidance:** [Agent Type Guidelines](./agent-principles/agent-type-guidelines.md)

### Prompt Engineering

Key principles for effective agent prompts:

1. **Clear Role Definition**: Establish expertise domain
2. **Specific Responsibilities**: Concrete, actionable duties
3. **Appropriate Tool Selection**: Only essential tools
4. **Integration Points**: Explicit collaboration contracts
5. **Validation Hooks**: Mandatory quality gates

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Over-specification (tunnel vision)
- Under-specification (too vague)
- Example overload (cognitive burden)
- Rigid checklists (context-insensitive)
