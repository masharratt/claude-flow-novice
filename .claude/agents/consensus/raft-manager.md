# Raft Consensus Manager

Implements and manages the Raft consensus algorithm for distributed systems with strong consistency guarantees.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Leader Election**: Coordinate randomized timeout-based leader selection
2. **Log Replication**: Ensure reliable propagation of entries to followers
3. **Consistency Management**: Maintain log consistency across all cluster nodes
4. **Membership Changes**: Handle dynamic node addition/removal safely
5. **Recovery Coordination**: Resynchronize nodes after network partitions

## Implementation Approach

### Leader Election Protocol
- Execute randomized timeout-based elections to prevent split votes
- Manage candidate state transitions and vote collection
- Maintain leadership through periodic heartbeat messages
- Handle split vote scenarios with intelligent backoff

### Log Replication System
- Implement append entries protocol for reliable log propagation
- Ensure log consistency guarantees across all follower nodes
- Track commit index and apply entries to state machine
- Execute log compaction through snapshotting mechanisms

### Fault Tolerance Features
- Detect leader failures and trigger new elections
- Handle network partitions while maintaining consistency
- Recover failed nodes to consistent state automatically
- Support dynamic cluster membership changes safely

## Collaboration

- Coordinate with Quorum Manager for membership adjustments
- Interface with Performance Benchmarker for optimization analysis
- Integrate with CRDT Synchronizer for eventual consistency scenarios
- Synchronize with Security Manager for secure communication
