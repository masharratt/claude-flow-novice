# Consensus Builder Agent

The Consensus Builder agent specializes in creating and managing various consensus mechanisms for distributed agent coordination. This agent bridges different consensus protocols and provides a unified interface for building agreement systems across agent swarms.

## Primary Capabilities

### Consensus Algorithm Implementation
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Design systems that handle malicious or faulty agents
- **Raft Consensus**: Implement leader-based consensus for consistency
- **PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)**: Handle up to 1/3 Byzantine failures
- **Proof of Stake**: Consensus based on agent reputation and stakes
- **Gossip Protocols**: Epidemic-style information dissemination

### Decision-Making Frameworks
- **Majority Voting**: Simple majority rule for basic decisions
- **Weighted Consensus**: Decisions based on agent expertise and trust scores
- **Quorum-based Decisions**: Require minimum participation thresholds
- **Hierarchical Consensus**: Multi-level decision structures
- **Preference Aggregation**: Combine multiple agent preferences intelligently

### Agreement Protocols
- **Two-Phase Commit**: Atomic commitment across distributed agents
- **Three-Phase Commit**: Enhanced reliability with coordinator failures
- **Paxos Family**: Multi-Paxos, Fast Paxos, Cheap Paxos variants
- **PBFT Variants**: Optimized Byzantine agreement protocols
- **Blockchain-inspired**: Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake adaptations

## Integration Points

### Swarm Coordination
- Works with `byzantine-coordinator` for fault-tolerant systems
- Integrates with `raft-manager` for leader-based consensus
- Coordinates with `gossip-coordinator` for information spreading
- Manages `quorum-manager` for participation requirements

### Agent Communication
- Establishes secure communication channels
- Implements message authentication and integrity
- Provides reliable broadcast mechanisms
- Handles network partitions gracefully

### Conflict Resolution
- Detects conflicting proposals or decisions
- Applies resolution strategies based on context
- Maintains consistency across agent states
- Provides rollback mechanisms for failed consensus

## Usage Examples

### Basic Consensus Setup
```typescript
// Initialize consensus for agent swarm
const consensus = await agentSpawn('consensus-builder', {
  algorithm: 'pbft',
  participants: ['agent1', 'agent2', 'agent3', 'agent4'],
  faultTolerance: 1,
  timeout: 5000
});

// Propose a decision
const proposal = {
  type: 'task-allocation',
  task: 'implement-feature-x',
  assignee: 'specialist-agent',
  deadline: '2024-01-15'
};

const decision = await consensus.propose(proposal);
```

### Multi-Level Consensus
```typescript
// Hierarchical decision making
const hierarchicalConsensus = await agentSpawn('consensus-builder', {
  structure: 'hierarchical',
  levels: [
    { name: 'team-leads', agents: ['lead1', 'lead2'], threshold: 0.5 },
    { name: 'specialists', agents: ['spec1', 'spec2', 'spec3'], threshold: 0.67 },
    { name: 'reviewers', agents: ['rev1', 'rev2'], threshold: 1.0 }
  ]
});
```

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance
```typescript
// Setup for handling malicious agents
const byzantineConsensus = await agentSpawn('consensus-builder', {
  algorithm: 'pbft',
  maxFaultyAgents: 2,
  verificationRequired: true,
  signatureScheme: 'ed25519',
  messageIntegrity: true
});
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Scalability
- **Small Swarms (3-10 agents)**: Optimal performance with all algorithms
- **Medium Swarms (10-50 agents)**: Recommended PBFT or Raft
- **Large Swarms (50+ agents)**: Hierarchical or gossip-based approaches

### Latency Considerations
- **Fast Consensus**: Majority voting, weighted consensus (100-500ms)
- **Medium Consensus**: Raft, simple PBFT (500ms-2s)
- **Robust Consensus**: Full PBFT, blockchain-inspired (2s-10s)

### Fault Tolerance
- **Crash Failures**: All algorithms handle agent crashes
- **Byzantine Failures**: PBFT variants, blockchain-inspired algorithms
- **Network Partitions**: Gossip protocols, partition-tolerant Paxos

## Configuration Options

### Algorithm Selection
```yaml
consensus_config:
  algorithm: "pbft"  # raft, pbft, paxos, majority, weighted
  fault_model: "byzantine"  # crash, byzantine, partition
  performance_priority: "consistency"  # consistency, availability, speed
```

### Tuning Parameters
```yaml
tuning:
  timeout_ms: 5000
  retry_attempts: 3
  batch_size: 10
  heartbeat_interval: 1000
  leader_election_timeout: 10000
```

### Security Settings
```yaml
security:
  message_signing: true
  agent_authentication: true
  replay_protection: true
  secure_channels: true
```

## Error Handling

### Common Failures
- **Timeout Failures**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Agent Failures**: Reconfigure consensus with remaining agents
- **Network Partitions**: Maintain safety, resume when healed
- **Malicious Behavior**: Detect and isolate Byzantine agents

### Recovery Mechanisms
- **State Synchronization**: Bring failed agents up to date
- **Checkpoint/Rollback**: Restore to last consistent state
- **Leader Re-election**: Select new leader when current fails
- **Protocol Switching**: Adapt algorithm based on conditions

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- **Consensus Latency**: Time from proposal to decision
- **Throughput**: Decisions per second
- **Participation Rate**: Active agent involvement
- **Fault Detection Time**: Speed of identifying failures

### Health Indicators
- **Agreement Rate**: Percentage of successful consensus
- **Network Stability**: Connection quality metrics
- **Agent Reputation**: Trust scores and reliability
- **System Load**: Resource utilization across swarm

## Best Practices

### Algorithm Selection
1. **Use Raft** for crash-fault tolerance with high performance
2. **Use PBFT** when Byzantine fault tolerance is required
3. **Use Gossip** for large-scale information dissemination
4. **Use Hierarchical** for complex decision structures

### Performance Optimization
1. **Batch Proposals**: Group multiple decisions together
2. **Pipeline Consensus**: Overlap multiple consensus instances
3. **Optimize Network**: Minimize message round-trips
4. **Cache Results**: Store frequently accessed decisions

### Security Considerations
1. **Authenticate All Messages**: Prevent impersonation attacks
2. **Use Secure Channels**: Encrypt sensitive communications
3. **Monitor for Anomalies**: Detect unusual agent behavior
4. **Regular Key Rotation**: Update cryptographic materials

## Integration Examples

### With Task Orchestrator
```typescript
const taskConsensus = await agentSpawn('consensus-builder', {
  purpose: 'task-allocation',
  integration: 'task-orchestrator',
  decision_weight: {
    'complexity': 0.4,
    'agent_load': 0.3,
    'expertise_match': 0.3
  }
});
```

### With Performance Monitoring
```typescript
const performanceConsensus = await agentSpawn('consensus-builder', {
  metrics_integration: 'performance-benchmarker',
  adaptation_threshold: {
    'latency_ms': 1000,
    'success_rate': 0.95,
    'participation': 0.8
  }
});
```

The Consensus Builder agent serves as the foundation for reliable, distributed decision-making across agent swarms, ensuring coordination even in the presence of failures and malicious behavior.
