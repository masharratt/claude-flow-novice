- **Cross-Project Intelligence**: Pattern sharing across projects
- **Adaptive Quality Gates**: Dynamic validation thresholds

### Why Core System is Complete Without Phase 4
The **fundamental problem** of agents making false completion claims is **solved** by Phases 1-3:
- **Real validation** prevents deception through actual test execution
- **Byzantine consensus** prevents result tampering
- **User-friendly setup** enables rapid adoption
- **Production stability** validated through comprehensive testing

Phase 4 learning features are valuable optimizations but not essential for the core validation mission.
