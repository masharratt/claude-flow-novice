- Kubernetes pod test (tmpfs configuration)
- Cloud VM test (AWS/GCP/Azure - pick one)
- 100 agent coordination in each environment
- Performance comparison matrix

**Agent Team** (spawn in single message):
```javascript
mcp__claude-flow-novice__swarm_init({
  topology: "mesh",
  maxAgents: 3,
  strategy: "balanced"
})

Task("DevOps 1", "Setup Docker test env with 100 agents, measure coordination time", "devops-engineer")
Task("DevOps 2", "Setup K8s test env with 100 agents, validate tmpfs", "devops-engineer")

```

**Success Criteria**:
- Works in ≥3 production environments
- Coordination time ≤2× WSL baseline
- Delivery rate ≥90% in all environments
- /dev/shm tmpfs accessible and performant

**Failure Handling**:
- Fails in all environments → **NO-GO** (pivot to network IPC)
- Fails in 1-2 environments → Document workarounds, proceed with caution

---

### Day 2: 8-Hour Stability Test

**Deliverables**:
- 8-hour continuous coordination (250 agents)
- Memory usage monitoring (15-minute intervals)
- File descriptor leak detection
- Performance drift analysis
- Stability report with metrics

**Agent Team**:
```javascript
mcp__claude-flow-novice__swarm_init({
  topology: "mesh",
  maxAgents: 4,
  strategy: "balanced"
})

Task("System Architect", "Design 8h stability test harness with monitoring", "system-architect")
Task("DevOps", "Execute 8h test with resource monitoring", "devops-engineer")
Task("Tester 1", "Monitor memory/FD metrics every 15min", "tester")
Task("Tester 2", "Analyze performance drift and delivery rates", "tester")
```

**Monitoring Metrics**:
- Memory growth (target: <10% per hour)
- File descriptor count (target: stable, no leaks)
- Coordination time drift (target: <20% variance)
- Delivery rate (target: ≥85% throughout)
- System load average

**Success Criteria**:

- FD leaks detected → FIX before Phase 1 (proper handle closure)
- Crashes within 8h → **NO-GO** or critical fix required

---

### Day 3: GO/NO-GO Decision

**Deliverables**:
- Consolidated validation report
- Risk assessment update
- GO/NO-GO recommendation with reasoning
- If GO: Updated Phase 1 plan with learnings
- If NO-GO: Pivot strategy document

**Agent Team**:
```javascript
mcp__claude-flow-novice__swarm_init({
  topology: "mesh",
  maxAgents: 4,
  strategy: "balanced"
})

Task("System Architect", "Analyze all test results and architecture implications", "system-architect")
Task("Product Owner", "Execute GOAP decision framework on validation data", "product-owner")
Task("Reviewer 1", "Review test coverage and identify gaps", "reviewer")
Task("Reviewer 2", "Security audit of test results", "security-specialist")
```

**Decision Framework**:

**GO Decision** (Proceed to Phase 1):
- ✅ Works in ≥3 production environments
- ✅ Stable for 8+ hours (no critical leaks)
- ✅ Delivery rate ≥85% across all tests
- ✅ No blocking security issues

**PIVOT Decision** (Modify approach):
- ⚠️ Works in 1-2 environments → Limited deployment scope
- ⚠️ Minor memory/FD growth → Implement periodic cleanup
- ⚠️ Delivery rate 80-85% → Reduce agent count targets

**NO-GO Decision** (Abandon bash approach):
- ❌ Fails in all production environments
- ❌ Memory leaks >20% per hour
- ❌ Delivery rate <80% consistently
- ❌ Critical security vulnerabilities

**Pivot Options** (if NO-GO):
1. Network IPC (sockets instead of files)
2. TypeScript V2 SDK coordination
3. Hybrid approach (TypeScript coordination + bash execution)
4. Scope reduction (Linux/WSL bare metal only)

**Hybrid Topology Configuration**:
- Coordinators: 6 in mesh topology
- Workers per coordinator: 50
- Total agents: 300
- Mesh coordination: All coordinators communicate
- Hierarchical coordination: Coordinator → 50 workers

**14-Day Stability Test**:
- Configuration: 6 coordinators × 50 workers = 300 agents
- Duration: 14 days continuous
- Chaos tests: Kill 1 coordinator on day 3, 7, 10
- Monitoring: Automated every 5 minutes
- Validation: Failover recovery <60s, message loss <5%

**Success Criteria**:
- 14-day stability: <3 non-critical incidents
- Delivery rate: ≥95% average (hybrid mesh)
- Coordinator failover: <60s recovery time
- Message loss during failover: <5%
- Load balancing: <15% variance across coordinators

**Failure Handling**:
- Failover >60s → Optimize failover algorithm
- Message loss >5% → Enhance reliability mechanisms
- Unbalanced load → Tune load balancing logic

## Dependencies & Critical Path

### Critical Path Analysis

**CRITICAL PATH** (Sequential Dependencies):
```
Sprint 0 Day 1 → Sprint 0 Day 2 → Sprint 0 Day 3 (GO/NO-GO) →
Phase 1 Sprint 1.1 → Phase 1 Sprint 1.2 → Phase 1 Sprint 1.3 (GATE 1) →
Phase 2 Sprint 2.1 → Phase 2 Sprint 2.2 (GATE 2) →
Phase 3 Sprint 3.1 → Phase 3 Sprint 3.2 → Phase 3 Sprint 3.3 (GATE 3) →
Phase 4 Stage 1 → Phase 4 Stage 2 → Phase 4 Stage 3 (GATE 4)

Total Critical Path: 24-26 weeks
```

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Phase 2: Sprint 2.1 (testing) and Sprint 2.2 (load tests) CAN overlap in weeks 9-10
  - Run load tests while expanding test coverage
  - Saves 1-2 weeks if executed well

- Phase 3: Sprint 3.1 (pooling) and Sprint 3.2 (batching) CAN run in parallel
  - Independent optimizations
  - Different agent teams (6 agents each = 12 total)
  - Saves 2 weeks if parallel execution successful

**Optimized Timeline with Parallelism**:
- Original: 26 weeks
- With Phase 2 overlap: 25 weeks
- With Phase 3 parallel: 23 weeks
- **Best case: 4.5 months (23 weeks)**

### Phase Dependencies

| Phase | Depends On | Blocks | Can Overlap? |
|-------|------------|--------|--------------|
| Sprint 0 | None | All phases | NO |
| Phase 1 | Sprint 0 GO | Phase 2, 3, 4 | NO |
| Phase 2 | Phase 1 GATE 1 | Phase 3, 4 | Sprint 2.1 + 2.2 partial |
| Phase 3 | Phase 2 GATE 2 | Phase 4 | Sprint 3.1 + 3.2 full parallel |
| Phase 4 | Phase 3 GATE 3 | None | Stages sequential |

### Sprint Dependencies (Detailed)

**Phase 1 (Sequential)**:
- Sprint 1.1 → Sprint 1.2 → Sprint 1.3
- No overlap possible (each builds on previous)

**Phase 2 (Partial Parallel)**:
- Sprint 2.1 (testing) can START while Sprint 2.2 (load tests) PREPARES
- Week 8: Sprint 2.1 unit tests + Sprint 2.2 load test design
- Week 9-10: Sprint 2.1 integration tests + Sprint 2.2 execution
- Saves 1 week

**Phase 3 (Full Parallel)**:
- Sprint 3.1 (agent pooling) independent of Sprint 3.2 (batching)
- Sprint 3.3 (benchmarking) depends on BOTH completing
- Run 3.1 and 3.2 simultaneously with separate agent teams
- Saves 2 weeks

**Phase 4 (Sequential)**:
- Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3 MUST be sequential
- Each stage validates previous before scaling up

## Confidence Score & Recommendations

**Planning Confidence Score**: 0.92

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Based on proven MVP data (708 agents, 97.8% delivery)
- ✅ Conservative timeline (4-6 months for AI-driven teams)
- ✅ Built-in validation at every phase (gates prevent bad progression)
- ✅ Risk mitigation strategies for all identified risks
- ✅ Parallel execution opportunities identified (saves 3 weeks)
- ⚠️ Unknown: Real production environment behavior (Sprint 0 validates)
- ⚠️ Unknown: Long-term stability beyond 24 hours (Phase 1 validates)

**High Confidence Areas**:
- Sprint breakdown and agent team sizing
- Performance targets (based on MVP)
- Critical path and dependencies
- Risk identification and mitigation

**Medium Confidence Areas**:
- Exact timeline duration (4-6 months range accounts for unknowns)
- Resource costs (cloud infrastructure varies)
- Parallelism success (depends on agent coordination quality)

**Recommendations**:

1. **EXECUTE Sprint 0 IMMEDIATELY** - 3 days to validate critical assumptions
   - High ROI: De-risks 6-month investment
   - Low cost: $50-100 and 3 days
   - Clear GO/NO-GO decision framework

2. **Prepare for Parallelism** - Plan agent teams for Phase 2 and 3 overlaps
   - Phase 2: 2 teams (testing + load tests)
   - Phase 3: 2 teams (pooling + batching)
   - Saves 3 weeks total

3. **Invest in Monitoring Early** - Setup in Phase 1 Sprint 1.3
   - Critical for Phase 4 production deployment
   - Reusable across all later phases
   - Enables data-driven decisions

4. **Document Learnings Continuously** - Update plan after each gate
   - Sprint 0 → Update Phase 1 based on environment findings
   - Phase 1 → Update Phase 2 based on stability data
   - Phase 2 → Update Phase 3 optimization priorities
   - Phase 3 → Update Phase 4 scale targets

5. **Maintain Flexibility** - Use CONDITIONAL PASS outcomes
   - Don't block on minor issues (80-90% targets)
   - Fix in next phase or document limitations
   - Avoid perfectionism blocking progress
