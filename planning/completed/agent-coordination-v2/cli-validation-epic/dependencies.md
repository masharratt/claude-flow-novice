# Epic Dependencies

## Phase Dependencies

### Phase 1: Critical Validation
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)

**Blocks**:
- Phase 2 (must validate environment and stability before performance testing)
- Phase 3 (optimization prototypes meaningless if basic stability fails)

**Critical Path**: YES - MUST PASS for epic to proceed

---

### Phase 2: Performance Validation
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 MUST PASS

**Rationale**:
- Real workload tests require stable environment (Phase 1)
- Chaos tests require baseline stability metrics (Phase 1)
- No point testing performance if basic compatibility fails

**Blocks**:
- Phase 3 (optimization targets based on Phase 2 baseline)

**Critical Path**: YES - MUST PASS for realistic production deployment

---

### Phase 3: Optimization Validation
**Dependencies**: Phase 1, Phase 2 (optional)

**Rationale**:
- Optimization baselines require Phase 2 real workload data
- Can be deferred to main plan Phase 3 if time-constrained
- NOT blocking for GO decision

**Blocks**: None

**Critical Path**: NO - Can adjust main plan based on results or defer

## Sprint Dependencies

### Phase 1 Sprints (Sequential)
1. **Sprint 1.1** (Environment Compatibility) → **Sprint 1.2** (Stability)
   - Must validate environment works before testing long-running stability
   - Stability tests use validated environments from Sprint 1.1

### Phase 2 Sprints (Parallel Possible)
1. **Sprint 2.1** (Real Workload) can run in parallel with **Sprint 2.2** (Chaos)
   - Both require Phase 1 completion
   - Independent test scenarios
   - Can parallelize to save time (recommend: Sprint 2.1 first for baseline data)

### Phase 3 Sprints (Fully Parallel)
1. All Sprint 3.x can run in parallel:
   - **Sprint 3.1** (Agent Pooling)
   - **Sprint 3.2** (Batch Messaging)
   - **Sprint 3.3** (Parallel Spawning)
   - **Sprint 3.4** (Directory Sharding)
   - Each optimization is independent
   - Recommend 4 parallel agent teams (1 per sprint)

## Decision Gates

### Gate 1: After Phase 1
**Decision**: GO / PIVOT / NO-GO

**GO Criteria** (proceed to Phase 2):
- ✅ Works in ≥3 production environments
- ✅ Stable for 24+ hours

**PIVOT Criteria** (modify approach):
- ⚠️ Works in 1-2 production environments → Limited deployment
- ⚠️ Stable for 8-16 hours → Implement periodic restarts

**NO-GO Criteria** (abandon bash approach):
- ❌ Fails in all production environments
- ❌ Memory leaks within 8 hours

### Gate 2: After Phase 2
**Decision**: GO / ADJUST / NO-GO

**GO Criteria** (proceed to main plan Phase 1):
- ✅ Real workload overhead <20%
- ✅ Failure recovery <60s

**ADJUST Criteria** (modify plan):
- ⚠️ Overhead 20-30% → Reduce max agent targets
- ⚠️ Recovery 60-120s → Enhance failover design

**NO-GO Criteria** (re-evaluate approach):
- ❌ Overhead >30%
- ❌ Recovery >2 minutes

### Gate 3: After Phase 3 (Optional)
**Decision**: ADJUST MAIN PLAN

**Outcome**:
- Update Phase 3 optimization targets based on empirical data
- Prioritize high-ROI optimizations
- Skip low-ROI optimizations
- Adjust timeline if needed

## Resource Sharing

### Infrastructure
- Docker/K8s cluster: Shared across all phases
- Cloud VMs: Phase 1 (setup), Phase 2 (reuse)
- Monitoring tools: Phase 1 (setup), Phase 2-3 (reuse)

### Test Artifacts
- Phase 1 baseline metrics → Used by Phase 2 for comparison
- Phase 2 performance data → Used by Phase 3 for optimization targets
- All test scripts → Reusable in main plan CI/CD (Phase 4)

## Timeline Dependencies

### Week 1: Phase 1 MUST complete
- Sprint 1.1: Days 1-2
- Sprint 1.2: Days 3-5
- Gate 1 Decision: End of Week 1

### Week 2: Phase 2 (if Phase 1 passes)
- Sprint 2.1: Days 6-9
- Sprint 2.2: Days 8-10 (can overlap with 2.1)
- Gate 2 Decision: End of Week 2

### Weeks 3-4: Phase 3 (optional)
- All Sprint 3.x in parallel: Days 11-15
- Gate 3 Decision: End of Week 3-4

**Total Critical Path**: 2 weeks minimum (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
**Total with Optimizations**: 3-4 weeks (Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3)

## Risk Cascade

### High-Risk Cascade (Phase 1 failure)
If Phase 1 fails → Phase 2 and 3 blocked → PIVOT required

**Mitigation**: Focus 100% effort on Phase 1 success first

### Medium-Risk Cascade (Phase 2 failure)
If Phase 2 fails → Phase 3 can still run (data for plan adjustment)

**Mitigation**: Run Phase 3 to inform alternative approaches

### Low-Risk Cascade (Phase 3 underperforms)
If Phase 3 optimizations <50% targets → Adjust main plan expectations

**Mitigation**: Already accounted for in decision framework
