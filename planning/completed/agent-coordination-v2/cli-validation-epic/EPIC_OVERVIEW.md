# CLI Coordination Validation Epic

**Goal**: Validate critical assumptions in CLI coordination production plan through targeted MVPs before committing to 6-9 month implementation

## Purpose

De-risk the CLI coordination production implementation by validating core assumptions in 2-4 weeks of focused testing.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Production environment compatibility testing (Docker, K8s, cloud VMs)
- Long-running stability validation (24+ hour tests)
- Real workload performance measurement
- Failure recovery and chaos engineering
- Performance optimization prototyping (agent pooling, batching, sharding)
- GO/NO-GO decision framework based on empirical data

### Out of Scope
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Windows) - deferred to Phase 5 of main plan
- Developer adoption/UX improvements - deferred to Phase 6 of main plan
- Full production implementation - only validation MVPs
- Production deployment - only testing in isolated environments

## Risk Profile
critical-high-risk

## Estimated Timeline
2-4 weeks (3 phases, 6 MVPs total)

## Success Criteria

**GO Decision** (Proceed with full implementation):
- ✅ Works in ≥3 production environments (Docker, K8s, cloud)
- ✅ Stable for 24+ hours (no memory leaks, no degradation)
- ✅ Real workload overhead <20%
- ✅ Failure recovery <60s with <5% message loss

**PIVOT Decision** (Modify approach):
- ❌ Fails in all tested production environments → Network IPC
- ❌ Memory leaks or FD exhaustion within 8 hours → Fix or pivot
- ❌ Real workload overhead >30% → Re-evaluate approach
- ❌ Failure recovery >2 minutes → Enhanced failover design

## Decision Authority Config

- Auto-approve threshold: 0.90 (high confidence required for GO decision)
- Auto-relaunch max iteration: 10
- Escalation criteria:
  - Critical assumption failure (environment incompatibility, stability issues)
  - Data loss in chaos tests
  - Performance degradation >30%

## Resource Requirements

**Team**: 1-2 developers (bash expertise, systems programming)
**Infrastructure**:
- Docker/K8s cluster
- Cloud VM access (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- Monitoring tools
- Load testing harness

**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks
**Cost**: Minimal (developer time + small cloud VM costs)
