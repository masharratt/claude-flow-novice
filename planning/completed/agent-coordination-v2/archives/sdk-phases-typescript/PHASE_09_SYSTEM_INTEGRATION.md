# PHASE 09: System Integration + SDK Performance Optimization

**Duration**: Week 9
**Phase Type**: Integration
**Dependencies**: PHASE_08_DEADLOCK_DETECTION (all core components complete)
**Next Phase**: PHASE_10_TESTING_VALIDATION

---

## Overview

Integrate all V2 components (state machine, dependency graph, message bus, completion detection, coordinators, help system, deadlock detection) into unified system. Optimize SDK performance including session pool management, artifact cache tuning, and query control overhead reduction.

## Success Criteria

### Numerical Thresholds
- [ ] **End-to-End Hierarchical Workflow**: Completes successfully
  - Measured via: Full hierarchical workflow integration test
  - Target: 100% success rate with 20+ agents
- [ ] **End-to-End Mesh Workflow**: Completes successfully
  - Measured via: Full mesh workflow integration test
  - Target: 100% success rate with 10+ peers
- [ ] **Session Pool Scale**: Handle 50+ concurrent agents
  - Measured via: Large-scale session pool tests
  - Target: 50+ agents without performance degradation
- [ ] **Artifact Storage Consistency**: <12ms (p95)
  - Measured via: Artifact cache performance benchmark
  - Target: Consistent <12ms latency under load
- [ ] **Query Control Overhead**: <5% token cost
  - Measured via: Token usage analysis with query control
  - Target: <5% overhead from pause/resume operations
- [ ] **Checkpoint Compression**: 60% storage reduction
  - Measured via: Checkpoint storage size analysis
  - Target: 60% smaller checkpoints via compression
