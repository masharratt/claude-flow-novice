# PHASE 12: SDK Production Hardening

**Duration**: Week 13
**Phase Type**: Production Optimization

  - Measured via: Production checkpoint recovery drills
  - Target: 100% successful recoveries
- [ ] **Nested Hierarchy Monitoring**: Cover all 10+ levels
  - Measured via: Monitoring dashboard validation
  - Target: Real-time visibility into 10+ nested levels
- [ ] **Background Process Detection**: <500ms failure detection
  - Measured via: Background process health check performance

- [ ] **Artifact Storage Scale**: Handle 10GB+ without degradation
  - Measured via: Artifact storage capacity tests
  - Target: Consistent performance at 10GB+ storage
- [ ] **Token Cost Reduction**: 50-75% savings validated
  - Measured via: Production token usage analysis
  - Target: 50-75% reduction vs non-SDK baseline
- [ ] **Performance Multipliers Sustained**: 10-20x spawning improvement
  - Measured via: Production performance benchmarks
  - Target: 10-20x faster spawning maintained under load
- [ ] **Recovery Speed**: <500ms checkpoint restoration under load
  - Measured via: Production recovery performance tests
  - Target: <500ms (p99) even under heavy load
