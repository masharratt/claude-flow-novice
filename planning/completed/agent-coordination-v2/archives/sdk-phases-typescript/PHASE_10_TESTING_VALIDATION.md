# PHASE 10: Performance Tuning + Testing Validation

**Duration**: Week 11 (Week 10 is performance tuning, Week 11 is testing)
**Phase Type**: Quality Assurance
**Dependencies**: PHASE_09_SYSTEM_INTEGRATION (integrated system operational)
**Next Phase**: PHASE_11_DOCUMENTATION_DEPLOYMENT

---

## Overview

Comprehensive testing including unit tests, integration tests, load testing, stress testing, chaos engineering, and security testing. Validate all SDK features including pause/resume, nested spawning, checkpoint recovery, and background process handling.

## Success Criteria

### Numerical Thresholds
- [ ] **Unit Test Coverage**: 100% for critical paths
  - Measured via: Jest coverage reports
  - Target: 100% statements/branches for core components
- [ ] **Integration Test Coverage**: 95%
  - Measured via: Integration test suite results
  - Target: 95% coverage of component interactions
- [ ] **Load Test Scale**: Handle 50 agents without failures
  - Measured via: Large-scale load testing
  - Target: Zero failures with 50+ concurrent agents
- [ ] **Chaos Test Recovery**: Recover from all failure scenarios
  - Measured via: Chaos engineering test suite
  - Target: 100% recovery from injected failures
- [ ] **Nested Spawning Depth**: Works reliably to 15+ levels
  - Measured via: Deep hierarchy stress tests
  - Target: 100% success rate for 15+ level hierarchies
- [ ] **Session Forking Scale**: Handle 100+ concurrent forks
  - Measured via: Session forking stress tests
  - Target: Zero failures with 100+ concurrent forks
