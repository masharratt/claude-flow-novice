ðŸš€ Repository Cleanup Plan: 20 Phases

  PROGRESS STATUS: 3/20 Phases Completed (15%)

  Critical Issues Identified:

  - âœ… 871 files in benchmark directory (conflicts resolved)
  - âœ… Test duplicates and obsolete files (RESOLVED)
  - 49 loose files in root directory
  - 65+ scripts with duplicates and build artifacts
  - âœ… Conflicting claude-flow initialization in benchmark/ (RESOLVED)
