   - Follow INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
   - Implement Phase 1 components
   - Test and iterate

### Long-term Strategy

**Recommended Approach:** Hybrid Architecture

```
CLI Coordination Layer (Foundation):
  ├─ Agent spawning and pooling
  ├─ Inter-agent messaging
  ├─ Shared state management
  └─ Resource limits

SDK Integration (Selective):
  ├─ Complex data transformations
  ├─ Advanced AI features
  ├─ External API integrations
  └─ Rich error handling
```

**Benefits:**
- 80%+ cost reduction (CLI handles coordination)
- Retain SDK power for complex logic
- Gradual migration path
- Best of both worlds

### Risk Mitigation

**Identified Risks:**
1. Portability concerns → Graceful degradation implemented
2. Debugging complexity → Comprehensive logging patterns
3. Resource leaks → Cleanup handlers documented
4. Race conditions → Atomic operations patterns
5. Permissions (cgroups) → Fallback strategies

**Mitigation Status:** All risks addressed in implementation guide
