# PHASE 11: Documentation + Production Deployment

**Duration**: Week 12
**Phase Type**: Documentation & Deployment
**Dependencies**: PHASE_10_TESTING_VALIDATION (all tests passed)
**Next Phase**: PHASE_12_PRODUCTION_HARDENING

---

## Overview

Complete all documentation including API reference, architecture guide, migration guide, and user tutorials. Deploy to production with gradual rollout, smoke testing, and monitoring. Remove V1 code after successful deployment validation.

## Success Criteria

### Numerical Thresholds
- [ ] **Documentation Coverage**: All components documented
  - Measured via: Documentation completeness checklist
  - Target: 100% coverage of all public APIs
- [ ] **Code Example Validation**: All examples tested and working
  - Measured via: Automated example validation
  - Target: 100% of code examples execute successfully
- [ ] **Staging Deployment**: Validated with production-like load
  - Measured via: Staging environment smoke tests
  - Target: Zero critical issues in staging for 48 hours
- [ ] **Production Rollout**: Zero incidents in first 48 hours
  - Measured via: Production monitoring and alerting
  - Target: Zero critical incidents post-deployment
- [ ] **V1 Migration**: Completed with zero regressions
  - Measured via: Migration validation tests
  - Target: 100% feature parity, zero regressions
- [ ] **Monitoring Coverage**: All key metrics tracked
  - Measured via: Monitoring dashboard completeness
  - Target: 100% coverage of performance/reliability metrics
