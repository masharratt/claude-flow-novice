I built Agentic Flow to easily switch between alternative low-cost AI models in Claude Code and Claude Agent SDK. For those comfortable using Claude agents and commands, it lets you take what you‚Äôve created and deploy fully hosted agents for real business purposes. Use Claude Code to get the agent working, then deploy it in your favorite cloud.

Zero-Cost Agent Execution with Intelligent Routing 
Agentic Flow runs Claude Code agents at near zero cost without rewriting a thing. The built-in model optimizer automatically routes every task to the cheapest option that meets your quality requirements, free local models for privacy, OpenRouter for 99% cost savings, Gemini for speed, or Anthropic when quality matters most. 

It analyzes each task and selects the optimal model from 27+ options with a single flag, reducing API costs dramatically compared to using Claude exclusively.

Autonomous Agent Spawning 
The system spawns specialized agents on demand through Claude Code‚Äôs Task tool and MCP coordination. It orchestrates swarms of 66+ pre-built Claue Flow agents (researchers, coders, reviewers, testers, architects) that work in parallel, coordinate through shared memory, and auto-scale based on workload. 

Transparent OpenRouter and Gemini proxies translate Anthropic API calls automatically, no code changes needed. Local models run direct without proxies for maximum privacy. Switch providers with environment variables, not refactoring.

Extend Agent Capabilities Instantly 
Add custom tools and integrations through the CLI, weather data, databases, search engines, or any external service, without touching config files. Your agents instantly gain new abilities across all projects. Every tool you add becomes available to the entire agent ecosystem automatically, with full traceability for auditing, debugging, and compliance. Connect proprietary systems, APIs, or internal tools in seconds, not hours.

Flexible Policy Control 
Define routing rules through simple policy modes:

Strict mode: Keep sensitive data offline with local models only
Economy mode: Prefer free models or OpenRouter for 99% savings
Premium mode: Use Anthropic for highest quality
Custom mode: Create your own cost/quality thresholds

OPTIMIZATION BENEFITS:
 üí∞ Cost Savings: 85-98% cheaper models for same quality tasks

 üéØ Smart Selection: Agent-aware (coder needs quality ‚â•85, researcher flexible)

 üìä 100+ Models: Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, DeepSeek, Llama, ONNX local

 ‚ö° Zero Overhead: <5ms decision time, no API calls during optimization

The policy defines the rules; the swarm enforces them automatically. Runs local for development, Docker for CI/CD, or Flow Nexus for production scale.

Agentic Flow is the framework for autonomous efficiency, one unified runner for every Claude Code agent, self-tuning, self-routing, and built for real-world deployment.

And 50+ more...

Option 2: MCP Tools (Direct Access)
Access 213 MCP tools for memory, swarms, GitHub, neural networks, and cloud sandboxes:

# Start all MCP servers (213 tools) - stdio transport
npx agentic-flow mcp start

# List all available tools
npx agentic-flow mcp list

# Check server status
npx agentic-flow mcp status

# Use tools in any agent automatically
export ENABLE_CLAUDE_FLOW_SDK=true
npx agentic-flow --agent coder --task "Store config in memory using memory_store"
MCP Transports:

stdio (default): Standard input/output for Claude Desktop integration
HTTP/SSE (new): HTTP server with Server-Sent Events for web apps

# Start HTTP/SSE server on port 8080
npm run mcp:http
# Endpoints:
# - HTTP: http://localhost:8080/mcp
# - SSE: http://localhost:8080/sse
# - Health: http://localhost:8080/health

# Start stdio server (default)
npm run mcp:stdio
MCP Tool Categories:

Agentic Flow (6 tools): Agent execution, creation, optimization, model selection
Claude Flow SDK (6 tools): In-process memory and swarm coordination
Claude Flow (101 tools): Neural networks, GitHub, workflows, performance, DAA

npx agentic-flow claude-code --provider openrouter "Write a Python function"

# Gemini (FREE tier)
npx agentic-flow claude-code --provider gemini "Create a REST API"

# Anthropic (direct, no proxy)
npx agentic-flow claude-code --provider anthropic "Help me debug"
How it works:

‚úÖ Auto-detects if proxy is running
‚úÖ Auto-starts proxy if needed (background)
‚úÖ Sets ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL to proxy endpoint
‚úÖ Configures provider-specific API keys
‚úÖ Spawns Claude Code with environment configured
‚úÖ Cleans up proxy on exit (optional)

Alternative: Manual Proxy (v1.1.11)

# Terminal 1: Start proxy server
export GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
npx agentic-flow proxy

# Terminal 2: Use Claude Code with proxy
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-proxy-dummy-key
claude  # Now uses Gemini instead of Anthropic!

# Or use OpenRouter (90% savings)
npx agentic-flow proxy --provider openrouter --model "openai/gpt-4o-mini"

# Stop servers
npx agentic-flow mcp stop
HTTP/SSE Transport (new for web applications):

# Start HTTP/SSE MCP server on port 8080
npm run mcp:http

# Or manually:
node dist/mcp/fastmcp/servers/http-sse.js

# Server provides 3 endpoints:
# - http://localhost:8080/mcp (MCP protocol)
# - http://localhost:8080/sse (Server-Sent Events)
# - http://localhost:8080/health (health check)

üìö Tutorial: Claude Code Integration
What is Claude Code Integration?
One command to use Claude Code with any provider - OpenRouter, Gemini, ONNX, or Anthropic.

No need to manually:

Start proxy servers
Export environment variables
Configure base URLs
Manage API keys

Just run npx agentic-flow claude-code --provider <name> "your task" and everything is handled automatically.

Quick Examples
# OpenRouter - 99% cost savings, wide model selection
npx agentic-flow claude-code --provider openrouter \
  "Write a Python function to parse JSON"

# Gemini - FREE tier available, fast responses
npx agentic-flow claude-code --provider gemini \
  "Create a simple REST API with Flask"

# Anthropic - Direct API, highest quality
npx agentic-flow claude-code --provider anthropic \
  "Help me implement OAuth2 authentication"

# ONNX - 100% offline, no API costs
npx agentic-flow claude-code --provider onnx \
  "Write a sorting algorithm"
How It Works
Behind the scenes:

Checks if proxy is running on port 3000 (or custom --port)
Auto-starts proxy if needed (OpenRouter/Gemini/ONNX)
Sets environment variables:
Spawns Claude Code with configured environment
Cleans up proxy on exit (unless --keep-proxy)

Advanced Options
# Use specific model
npx agentic-flow claude-code \
  --provider openrouter \
  --model "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct" \
  "Write complex code"

# Custom proxy port
npx agentic-flow claude-code \
  --provider gemini \
  --port 8080 \
  "Generate code"

# Keep proxy running for multiple sessions
npx agentic-flow claude-code \
  --provider openrouter \
  --keep-proxy \
  "First task"

# Reuse running proxy (no auto-start)
npx agentic-flow claude-code \
  --provider openrouter \
  --no-auto-start \
  "Second task"
Alternative: Bash Wrapper Script
For frequent use, copy the wrapper script to your PATH:

# Install wrapper
cp node_modules/agentic-flow/scripts/claude-code ~/bin/
chmod +x ~/bin/claude-code

# Usage - cleaner syntax
claude-code openrouter "Write a function"
claude-code gemini "Create an API"
claude-code anthropic "Debug my code"
Validation
Test that all providers work correctly:

# Test OpenRouter
npx agentic-flow claude-code --provider openrouter \
  "print hello world in python"

# Test Gemini
npx agentic-flow claude-code --provider gemini \
  "print hello world in python"

# Test Anthropic
npx agentic-flow claude-code --provider anthropic \
  "print hello world in python"
Expected output: Clean Python code with no XML tags:

print("Hello, World!")
