# PHASE 08: Deadlock Detection + Recovery via Checkpoints

**Duration**: Week 8
**Phase Type**: Fault Tolerance
**Dependencies**: PHASE_07_HELP_SYSTEM (help system operational)
**Next Phase**: PHASE_09_SYSTEM_INTEGRATION

---

## Overview

Implement deadlock detection using Wait-For-Graph (WFG) cycle detection and recovery mechanisms leveraging SDK checkpoints. Enable multi-level deadlock detection across nested agent hierarchies and priority-based pause/resume for deadlock resolution.

## Success Criteria

### Numerical Thresholds
- [ ] **WFG Cycle Detection**: Complete in <500ms for typical graphs
  - Measured via: Cycle detection algorithm benchmark
  - Target: <500ms (p95) for graphs with 50+ nodes
- [ ] **Deadlock Detection Scale**: Works across 50+ agents
  - Measured via: Large-scale deadlock detection tests
  - Target: 100% detection rate for 50+ agent swarms
- [ ] **Checkpoint Rollback**: Restore pre-deadlock state
  - Measured via: Checkpoint rollback validation tests
  - Target: 100% state consistency after rollback
- [ ] **Recovery Speed**: <500ms from checkpoint
  - Measured via: Checkpoint recovery benchmark
  - Target: <500ms (p99) for full state restoration
- [ ] **Deadlock Recovery Success Rate**: >95%
  - Measured via: Chaos engineering deadlock scenarios
  - Target: 95%+ successful recoveries
- [ ] **Total Recovery Time**: <1s including detection + recovery
  - Measured via: End-to-end deadlock recovery tests
  - Target: <1s total from deadlock to resolution
