## Technical Implementation Details

### Agent State Definitions
```typescript
// 7 distinct agent states
enum AgentState {
  IDLE = 'idle',           // Agent available for work
  WORKING = 'working',     // Actively executing task
  WAITING = 'waiting',     // Blocked on dependency
  HELPING = 'helping',     // Assisting another agent
  BLOCKED = 'blocked',     // Deadlocked or error state
  COMPLETED = 'completed', // Task finished successfully
  ERROR = 'error'          // Execution failed
}
```

### State Transition Rules
```typescript
// Valid state transition matrix
const STATE_TRANSITIONS: Record<AgentState, AgentState[]> = {
  [AgentState.IDLE]: [AgentState.WORKING],
  [AgentState.WORKING]: [AgentState.WAITING, AgentState.HELPING, AgentState.COMPLETED, AgentState.ERROR],
  [AgentState.WAITING]: [AgentState.WORKING, AgentState.BLOCKED, AgentState.ERROR],
  [AgentState.HELPING]: [AgentState.WORKING, AgentState.IDLE],
  [AgentState.BLOCKED]: [AgentState.WORKING, AgentState.ERROR],
  [AgentState.COMPLETED]: [],
  [AgentState.ERROR]: [AgentState.IDLE]
};
```

### SDK Integration Points
```typescript
// Auto-checkpoint on state transitions
class StateMachine {
  async transition(agentId: string, newState: AgentState): Promise<void> {
    // Validate transition
    this.validateTransition(currentState, newState);

    // Pause agent during transition (zero token cost)
    await this.queryController.pauseAgent(agentId);

    // Create checkpoint BEFORE state change
    const checkpoint = await this.checkpointManager.createCheckpoint(
      agentId,
      `state_transition_${currentState}_to_${newState}`
    );

    // Update state in artifact storage
    await this.stateStorage.setState(agentId, newState, checkpoint.messageUUID);

    // Broadcast state change via SDK events
    await this.sessionManager.broadcastEvent('state_change', {
      agentId,
      from: currentState,
      to: newState,
      checkpoint: checkpoint.id
    });

    // Resume agent after transition
    await this.queryController.resumeAgent(agentId);
  }
}
```

### Artifact-Backed Persistence
```typescript
// State storage using SDK artifacts (3.7x faster than JSON)
interface StateStorage {
  setState(agentId: string, state: AgentState, checkpointUUID: string): Promise<void>;
  getState(agentId: string): Promise<AgentState | undefined>;
  getAllStates(): Promise<Map<string, AgentState>>;
  restoreFromCheckpoint(agentId: string, checkpointId: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: State Transition Validation Bugs
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: High (invalid state transitions corrupt agent lifecycle)

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive state transition matrix testing
- Integration tests for all valid transition paths
- Runtime validation throws errors on invalid transitions
- State transition audit logging for debugging

### Risk 2: Checkpoint Performance Overhead
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium (checkpoint creation slows state transitions)

**Mitigation**:
- Async checkpoint creation (non-blocking)
- Checkpoint batching for multiple transitions
- Lazy checkpoint cleanup (background process)
- Performance budgets enforced (100ms p99 latency)

### Risk 3: Artifact Storage Integration Issues
**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:
- Gradual migration from JSON to artifacts
- Dual-write strategy during transition period
- Artifact storage fallback to JSON on errors
- Comprehensive integration tests with artifact backend

### Risk 4: SDK Event Listener Failures
**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: High (state changes not broadcast to agents)

**Mitigation**:
- Event listener health monitoring
- Retry logic for failed broadcasts
- Fallback to polling if event system fails
- Dead letter queue for failed events

## Integration Points

### With PHASE_00 (SDK Foundation)
- Uses SessionManager for event broadcasting
- Leverages CheckpointManager for state snapshots
- Utilizes QueryController for agent pausing
- Stores state in ArtifactStorage (binary format)

### With Future Phases
- **PHASE_02 (Dependency Graph)**: State transitions trigger dependency resolution
- **PHASE_03 (Message Bus)**: State changes published to state channel
- **PHASE_04 (Completion Detection)**: COMPLETED state triggers completion probes
- **PHASE_07 (Help System)**: WAITING state triggers help requests
- **PHASE_08 (Deadlock Detection)**: BLOCKED state feeds into WFG analysis

### With Existing V1 System
- V1 state tracking migrates to V2 state machine
- Backward compatibility layer for V1 state queries
- Gradual migration path with dual-write support
