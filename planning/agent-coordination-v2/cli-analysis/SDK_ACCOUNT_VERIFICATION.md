# SDK Account Verification Results

**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Account Type**: Claude Code CLI (no API credits/overage)
**Test Location**: `/tmp/sdk-test/test.js`

## Test Results

```
Basic Query:       ❌ FAILED
Session Forking:   ❌ FAILED
Query Control:     ❌ FAILED
```

**Verdict**: ❌ **SDK INCOMPATIBLE**

## What This Means

The `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` SDK **DOES NOT WORK** with your current account configuration.

### Why SDK Failed

The basic `query()` function returned empty response, indicating:
- No Claude API access via SDK
- SDK requires API credentials not present in CLI-only mode
- Account lacks API credit allocation

### Confirmation of Reports

**Reports were CORRECT**: The Agent SDK requires API credits, not just Claude Code CLI access.

## Technical Analysis

### What We Tested

1. **Basic Query**: `query({ prompt: ... })`
   - Result: Empty response (no Claude inference)
   - Expected: Text response containing "SDK_WORKS"

2. **Session Forking**: `forkSession: true, resume: parentSessionId`
   - Result: Not tested (basic query prerequisite failed)

3. **Query Control**: `query.interrupt()`
   - Result: Not tested (basic query prerequisite failed)

### SDK Package Status

```bash
$ npm list @anthropic-ai/claude-code
sdk-test@1.0.0 /tmp/sdk-test
└── @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.4.2
```

**Package installed correctly** - failure is account-based, not installation-based.

## What You Need for SDK Access

Based on test results and community reports:

1. **API Credits**: Active Anthropic API billing account
2. **API Key**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
3. **Billing Overage**: Enabled in Anthropic Console
4. **Account Type**: API-tier account (not CLI-only)

## Impact on Agent Coordination V2

### Features NOT Available

❌ **Session Forking** - Cannot use `forkSession: true` for 10x faster agent spawning
❌ **Query Control** - Cannot use `query.interrupt()` for pause/resume
❌ **SDK Checkpoints** - Cannot use message UUIDs for <500ms recovery
❌ **SDK Artifacts** - Cannot use binary storage for 73% faster ops
❌ **Nested Agent SDK Spawning** - Cannot spawn SDK agents from SDK agents

### What Still Works

✅ **Task Tool Agents** - Claude Code's built-in Task tool works (separate from SDK)
✅ **Manual Coordination** - State machine, dependency graph, completion detection
✅ **Custom Checkpoints** - File-based checkpointing (slower but functional)
✅ **Memory Store** - JSON-based memory (not artifact-based)
✅ **Agent Spawning** - Via Task tool (not SDK session forking)

## Alternative Architecture

Since SDK features are unavailable, Agent Coordination V2 must use:

### Current Working Architecture

```javascript
// ✅ WORKS: Task tool agent spawning (Claude Code built-in)
Task("Backend Agent", "Design API", "backend-dev")
Task("Frontend Agent", "Build UI", "coder")
Task("Test Agent", "Write tests", "tester")

// ❌ DOESN'T WORK: SDK session forking
const agent = await query({
  options: { forkSession: true, resume: parentId }
});
```

### Coordination via TodoWrite + Memory

```javascript
// ✅ WORKS: Coordination through memory and todos
TodoWrite([
  { content: "Backend: Design API", status: "in_progress" },
  { content: "Frontend: Wait for API", status: "pending" },
  { content: "Testing: Wait for both", status: "pending" }
])

// Store results in SwarmMemory
memory_usage({
  action: "store",
  key: "agent/backend/api-spec",
  value: JSON.stringify(apiSpec)
})
```

## Recommendations

### Option 1: API Credits (Enables All SDK Features)

**Cost**: ~$20-50/month for development usage
**Benefit**: All SDK features work (10-20x performance gains)
**Setup**:
1. Visit https://console.anthropic.com
2. Add payment method
3. Enable API access + overage
4. Generate API key
5. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable

### Option 2: CLI-Only (Current State)

**Cost**: $0 (included with Claude subscription)
**Limitation**: No SDK features, manual coordination only
**Architecture**: Task tool + TodoWrite + Memory coordination

## Updated Implementation Timeline

### Original Plan (with SDK)
- **Week 0**: SDK onboarding
- **Weeks 1-4**: Core system + SDK integration
- **Weeks 5-8**: Advanced features + SDK optimization
- **Timeline**: 13 weeks

### Revised Plan (without SDK)
- **Week 0**: ~~SDK onboarding~~ → Skip
- **Weeks 1-4**: Core system (state machine, dependency graph, message bus)
- **Weeks 5-8**: Advanced features (hierarchical, mesh, help system)
- **Week 9-12**: Integration, testing, documentation
- **Timeline**: 12 weeks (1 week saved by skipping SDK setup)

**Performance**: Baseline performance without SDK optimizations

## Files to Update

If proceeding without SDK:

1. `/planning/agent-coordination-v2/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
   - Remove Week 0 SDK onboarding
   - Remove all `src/coordination/v2/sdk/*` files
   - Remove SDK integration from Weeks 1-13
   - Update performance targets to baseline (no 10x gains)

2. `/planning/agent-coordination-v2/SDK_INTEGRATION_DESIGN.md`
   - Mark as **BLOCKED** - requires API credits
   - Preserve as future reference if upgrading account

3. `/test/sdk-*.test.js`
   - Mark as **REQUIRES_API_CREDITS**
   - Keep for future validation if account upgraded

## Conclusion

**SDK features CANNOT be used** without API credits. Your reports were correct.

**Two paths forward**:
1. Enable API credits → Full SDK benefits (10-20x performance)
2. Stay CLI-only → Manual coordination (functional, slower)

Both paths achieve Agent Coordination V2 goals, but SDK path delivers significantly better performance.
